## Overview
This document defines the authoritative rules for agents/LLMs using the `react_implementation_discipline` skill.

Key constraints:
- Follow `agent-policy-v1` unless explicitly overridden by an allowed migration strategy.
- If a rule references a rule ID, the rule ID must be followed exactly.

## Rule index
- rid-overview-scope
- rid-process
- rid-output

# Overview

## Summary

This document defines the authoritative rules for the `react_implementation_discipline` skill.

This skill operates under:
- `agent-policy-v1` (mandatory baseline policy)

All rules defined here are binding for agents and LLMs using this skill.

---

## Rule: Skill Scope Definition
**Rule ID:** rid-overview-scope  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Ensures implementation discipline stays within boundaries.

### Requirement

- The skill must enforce boundary and quality gates.
- The skill must follow the implementation plan and file touch list.
- The skill must minimize churn and avoid unrelated refactors.
- The skill must inherit and enforce shared baseline constraints from
  `agent-policy-v1`.

### Forbidden

- Skipping required validation steps.
- Modifying architecture documents unless explicitly requested.
- Defining local mandatory rules that conflict with `agent-policy-v1`.

### Notes

- Pause if implementation would violate scope or policy.

---

# Implementation Process

## Summary
Defines the disciplined workflow for applying changes.

---

## Rule: Plan-Driven Implementation
**Rule ID:** rid-process  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Ensures changes align with the approved plan.

### Requirement

- Follow the file touch plan and layer justification.
- Apply minimal changes required to satisfy the request.
- Validate boundary rules after changes.

### Forbidden

- Editing files outside the approved plan.
- Introducing new dependencies without approval.

### Notes

- Use deterministic defaults when implementation choices are unclear.

---

# Output Contract

## Summary
Defines the expected output structure for implementation discipline results.

---

## Rule: Structured Implementation Output
**Rule ID:** rid-output  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Ensures results are verifiable and traceable.

### Requirement

- Output must list files changed and checks performed.
- Output must report boundary audit outcomes.
- Output must include any deviations or unresolved risks.

### Forbidden

- Omitting validation results.
- Returning unstructured prose instead of structured output.

### Notes

- Keep outputs concise and focused on verification.
