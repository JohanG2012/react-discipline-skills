# Overview

## Summary

This document defines authoritative constraints for
`react_implementation_discipline`.

This skill operates under:

- `agent-policy-v1` (mandatory baseline policy)

All rules here are binding for agents and LLMs using this skill.

---

## Rule: Skill Scope Definition
**Rule ID:** rid-overview-scope  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Keep implementation output disciplined, reviewable, and aligned
with architecture and policy.

### Requirement

- Enforce plan fidelity: implementation must follow the approved revised plan.
- Enforce boundary and quality gates before output is finalized.
- Enforce minimal churn: avoid unrelated refactors and speculative cleanup.
- Inherit and enforce shared baseline constraints from `agent-policy-v1`.
- Treat these by default as out of scope unless explicitly approved:
  - architecture migration
  - new dependencies
  - unrelated cleanup/refactor work
  - policy/spec document edits
- Require deterministic output states:
  - `accepted`
  - `blocked`
  - `dependency_error`
  - `validation_error`

### Forbidden

- Skipping required validation, boundary, or scope checks.
- Modifying architecture/specification policy artifacts unless explicitly requested.
- Defining local mandatory rules that conflict with `agent-policy-v1`.
- Returning unqualified implementation output when mandatory checks fail.

### Notes

- If required repository context is unavailable, fail closed.
- Always prefer bounded, reviewable changes over large structural drift.

---

# Implementation Process

## Summary

Defines disciplined, plan-driven implementation with fail-closed safeguards.

---

## Rule: Plan-Driven Implementation
**Rule ID:** rid-process  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Ensure deterministic execution that matches approved planning and
policy constraints.

### Requirement

- Validate required inputs before any implementation output:
  - `revised_plan`
  - `detection_result`
  - `reuse_decisions`
  - repository context needed for convention and boundary checks
- If required inputs are invalid, return `validation_error` and stop.
- If required repository context is unavailable, return `dependency_error` and
  stop.
- Dependency-error handling must include actionable fallback context-bundle
  requirements for no-direct-access execution.
- Enforce plan fidelity:
  - touch only files in the revised plan
  - allow extra touches only for minimal dependency/export wiring requirements
  - record each extra touch with one-line rationale
- Enforce boundary checks for modified artifacts:
  - `ui/**` must not import from `features/**`, `api/**`, `store/**`, `pages/**`
  - `api/**` must not import React or UI/presentation layers
  - `pages/**` must not call canonical endpoint modules directly
  - hooks must follow documented exception policy for `hooks/** -> api/**`
- Enforce convention matching using nearest repository analogs:
  - naming style
  - export style
  - local error-handling patterns
  - path alias conventions
- Enforce minimal churn:
  - no unrelated renames
  - no broad formatting-only rewrites
  - no speculative refactors
- Enforce file-size discipline:
  - soft caps by layer: pages `120-150`, sections `200-250`, composites
    `200-250`, hooks `150-200`, endpoints `80-120`, primitives `<=150`
  - mandatory split/extraction when any touched file would exceed `400` lines
  - hard stop when any touched file would exceed `600` lines
- Enforce out-of-scope policy:
  - unapproved migration/dependency/cleanup/spec edits must be excluded
  - represent excluded work through bounded scope-expansion guidance
- Require final quality-gate checks before completion and map result to final
  state (`accepted` or `blocked`).

### Forbidden

- Implementing without required upstream inputs.
- Continuing execution after missing repository context.
- Returning accepted output when mandatory quality checks fail.
- Including unapproved out-of-scope work in implementation payload.
- Violating boundary rules to satisfy convenience implementation.

### Notes

- Prefer deterministic defaults when safe and compliant.
- Keep changes reviewable and constrained to requested scope.

---

# Output Contract

## Summary

Defines strict output envelopes for accepted, blocked, validation-error, and
dependency-error outcomes.

---

## Rule: Structured Implementation Output
**Rule ID:** rid-output  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Ensure implementation outcomes are machine-consumable,
review-ready, and policy-verifiable.

### Requirement

- Output must be JSON only.
- Output must include:
  - `schema_version`
  - `skill`
  - `version`
  - `result_type`
  - `validation_summary`
- `validation_summary` must report:
  - `is_valid`
  - `stage`
  - `quality_check_status`
  - `boundary_status`
  - `scope_deviation_status`
  - `final_state`
  - `errors`
  - optional `warnings`
- Supported `result_type` values:
  - `implementation_package`
  - `validation_error`
  - `dependency_error`
- `implementation_package` must include `output_package` with:
  - `changed_files`
  - optional `updated_patches`
  - optional `new_files`
  - `quality_checks`
  - `boundary_audit`
  - `scope_deviations`
  - optional `required_fixes` (required when `final_state=blocked`)
  - optional `recommended_follow_up_scope`
  - optional `notes`
- If `scope_expansion_needed` is present, include
  `output_package.recommended_follow_up_scope`.
- `validation_error` output must include `notes` and must not include
  `output_package`.
- `dependency_error` output must include:
  - `dependency_issue`
  - `fallback_context_bundle_requirements`
  - `notes`
  and must not include `output_package`.

### Forbidden

- Returning unstructured prose.
- Omitting validation summary fields.
- Returning `blocked` without `required_fixes`.
- Returning error outputs with implementation payload.

### Notes

- Keep notes concise (max 5 items where applicable).
- Prefer deterministic field population for downstream consumers.

---

# Validation Gates

## Summary

Defines mandatory implementation validation checks and execution order.

---

## Rule: Validation Gate Sequence
**Rule ID:** rid-validation-gates  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Catch high-risk defects early and keep completion criteria
consistent.

### Requirement

- Always execute this high-signal sequence before final output:
  1. Boundary audit
  2. Type/lint checks when tooling exists
  3. Loading/error/empty state review when relevant
  4. Query key/invalidation sanity when relevant
  5. Scope/minimal churn audit
  6. Existing test suite checks when present
- Required always:
  - boundary rules satisfied
  - no fetching outside canonical endpoint ownership
  - plan-followed minimal churn
- Required when tooling exists:
  - type/lint commands pass using repository-standard checks
- Required when test suite exists:
  - relevant tests updated or added for changed behavior
- Any failed mandatory gate must set `final_state=blocked`.

### Forbidden

- Declaring success when required gates were skipped.
- Treating failed mandatory gates as warnings-only output.

### Notes

- Keep validation deterministic and evidence-based.

---

# Scope Governor

## Summary

Defines hard execution caps and bounded scope expansion behavior.

---

## Rule: Scope and Churn Caps
**Rule ID:** rid-scope-governor  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Prevent implementation drift and keep output reviewable.

### Requirement

- Enforce default hard caps unless explicitly overridden:
  - max files touched: `8`
  - max new files: `4`
  - max moved/renamed files: `0`
  - max new dependencies: `0`
  - max new top-level folders: `0`
- When caps are exceeded but minimum delivery is possible:
  - return the in-cap minimal output
  - include bounded `scope_expansion_needed[]` with `why` and `would_touch`
  - include concise `recommended_follow_up_scope[]`
- Out-of-scope requests without explicit approval must be excluded from
  implementation payload.

### Forbidden

- Expanding scope silently.
- Adding dependencies without explicit approval.
- Mixing migration moves with feature behavior without explicit request.

### Notes

- Favor smallest viable in-cap delivery first.

---

# Access and Write Control

## Summary

Defines repository-access requirements and fail-closed behavior when context is
missing.

---

## Rule: Context Access and Write Discipline
**Rule ID:** rid-access-control  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Prevent unsafe assumptions and maintain controlled change output.

### Requirement

- Require repository read/search capability for convention and boundary checks.
- Minimum context capabilities:
  - list relevant tree
  - search patterns
  - read target files and config files
- If direct repository context is unavailable, return `dependency_error` with
  actionable `fallback_context_bundle_requirements`, including at least:
  - feature-relevant file tree
  - `package.json`
  - router/entry files when applicable
  - canonical API home information
  - sample primitive/composite/section/hook/endpoint modules
- Default write control behavior:
  - produce reviewable patch/new-file output
  - avoid direct structural writes outside approved plan
  - never auto-edit `SPEC.md`, architecture docs, or `specs/**` unless requested

### Forbidden

- Producing accepted implementation output without required context evidence.
- Silent direct-write behavior that bypasses planned review controls.

### Notes

- Fail closed on missing context; do not guess structural conventions.

---

# Output Mode Selection

## Summary

Defines deterministic selection between snippet/diff updates and full-file output.

---

## Rule: Output Mode Selection
**Rule ID:** rid-output-mode-selection  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Keep implementation output reviewable while minimizing misapply risk.

### Requirement

- For existing files, default to changed snippets or unified diffs.
- Automatically prefer unified diff when:
  - edits are non-adjacent in one file
  - imports/exports and logic are changed together
  - snippet-only output risks incorrect application
- For new files, provide full file content.
- Do not return unrelated full files.
- If an existing file is very small and fully changed, full-file output is
  allowed.
- If a newly created file would exceed about 250 lines, prefer splitting
  responsibilities before finalizing output.

### Forbidden

- Returning entire existing files by default.
- Mixing unrelated file content into one output package.

### Notes

- Favor the smallest clear output that preserves apply correctness.

---

# UI Genericity

## Summary

Defines anti-leakage rules for primitives/composites during implementation.

---

## Rule: UI Genericity and Anti-Leakage
**Rule ID:** rid-ui-genericity  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Prevent domain coupling and unstable abstractions in shared UI.

### Requirement

- When updating shared composites:
  - prefer slots/children/render composition
  - do not add domain-specific props or enums
  - do not import domain types
- When updating primitives:
  - small ergonomic props are allowed
  - do not introduce domain mode flags
- If reuse would require leaky abstraction via `variant`, `mode`, or `context`
  flags, prefer feature-section ownership or safe duplication.
- Keep domain behavior in feature sections/hooks, not in shared UI layers.

### Forbidden

- Encoding domain terms or domain logic in shared `ui/**` components.
- Forcing multi-domain behavior through large flag matrices in composites.

### Notes

- Optimize for long-term divergence safety over short-term over-generalization.

---

# Data Flow and Exports

## Summary

Defines execution order, data-flow boundaries, and export wiring discipline.

---

## Rule: Bottom-Up Flow and Minimal Export Wiring
**Rule ID:** rid-data-flow-exports  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Keep implementation predictable and avoid boundary leakage.

### Requirement

- Prefer bottom-up implementation order when applicable:
  1. DTO/type boundaries
  2. endpoint modules
  3. domain/adapters
  4. feature hooks
  5. UI primitives/composites
  6. feature sections
  7. page composition
- Enforce predictable data flow:
  - endpoint modules return transport DTO data
  - feature layer maps DTO to domain where needed
  - sections render domain-facing data
  - pages compose sections
- Do not fetch inside UI components when canonical endpoint flow exists.
- Wire exports minimally:
  - update nearest existing barrel only when the area already uses barrels
  - avoid introducing new barrel files unless local convention requires it

### Forbidden

- Bypassing endpoint ownership from UI/page layers.
- Creating broad barrel rewires unrelated to requested change.

### Notes

- Keep wiring changes local to reduce merge and review risk.

---

# Quick Validation

## Summary

Defines pre-output lightweight checks required for disciplined completion.

---

## Rule: Quick Validation Checklist
**Rule ID:** rid-quick-validation  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Catch common correctness issues before output is finalized.

### Requirement

- Before final output, confirm:
  - no circular imports introduced by touched files
  - no forbidden imports or boundary violations
  - changed code references valid existing types/contracts
  - query keys remain stable where server-state hooks are updated
  - loading/error/empty handling remains consistent with local patterns
- If repository tests exist and touched behavior requires updates, include
  relevant test adjustments.

### Forbidden

- Finalizing output without running these checks.
- Marking output accepted when these checks identify unresolved failures.

### Notes

- This rule complements (not replaces) formal lint/type/test commands.

---

# Ambiguity Strategy

## Summary

Defines deterministic behavior when local patterns conflict or are unclear.

---

## Rule: Ambiguity Resolution Strategy
**Rule ID:** rid-ambiguity-strategy  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Keep delivery moving while minimizing structural mistakes.

### Requirement

- When multiple local patterns exist, use this order:
  1. `follow-existing`: mimic the area being modified
  2. `introduce-boundaries`: keep new module internally consistent
  3. `migrate-as-you-touch`: only when it reduces confusion without scope drift
- Prefer the lowest-churn compliant option when multiple choices are valid.
- Pause only for structural blockers:
  - no boundary-compliant implementation path exists
  - conflicting patterns prevent safe placement
  - scope cannot be reduced to a safe minimum
- For non-structural ambiguity, apply deterministic defaults and proceed.

### Forbidden

- Pausing for minor naming/style choices with safe defaults.
- Introducing broad migrations to resolve local ambiguity.

### Notes

- Interruptions should be rare and high-leverage.

---

# Chaotic Change Guardrails

## Summary

Defines explicit anti-patterns that must be avoided during implementation.

---

## Rule: Anti-Chaotic Change Guardrails
**Rule ID:** rid-chaotic-change-guardrails  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Prevent architecture drift and uncontrolled maintenance debt.

### Requirement

- Do not introduce new `shared/` or `common/` dumping-ground abstractions.
- Do not move inline utility/domain logic into pages/sections when it belongs
  in domain/lib layers.
- Do not bypass canonical endpoint layers from hooks/UI.
- Do not combine structural migration with feature behavior in the same change
  unless explicitly requested.
- Keep feature changes local and migration-aware; avoid two-architecture
  parallelism.

### Forbidden

- Refactor-for-future changes without immediate feature value.
- Creating mega components with many mode/flag combinations.

### Notes

- If migration work is necessary, isolate it as explicit scope.

---

# Pause Defaults Protocol

## Summary

Defines deterministic default behavior and strict pause protocol for structural
ambiguity.

---

## Rule: Deterministic Defaults and Pause Protocol
**Rule ID:** rid-pause-defaults-protocol  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Avoid unnecessary interruptions while preventing structural debt.

### Requirement

- Apply deterministic defaults when safe:
  - ambiguous feature owner -> choose most specific domain
  - unclear UI pattern -> keep logic in feature section
  - unclear reuse/generalize -> prefer section-level duplication
  - unclear state ownership -> prefer local state first
  - unclear abstraction value -> keep implementation concrete
  - unclear naming -> match nearest neighbor naming
- Pause only when cost of guessing is structurally high:
  - no boundary-compliant path exists
  - conflicting patterns block safe placement
  - scope cannot be reduced to minimum safe delivery
- When pausing, follow clean protocol:
  1. state ambiguity precisely
  2. offer 2-3 concrete options
  3. recommend a default option
  4. stop and wait for confirmation
- Keep questions high-leverage and structural; avoid broad or stylistic
  questions when safe defaults exist.

### Forbidden

- Pausing for minor naming/styling choices.
- Asking vague architecture questions during implementation.
- Blocking delivery when a safe deterministic default exists.

### Notes

- Default pause mode is effectively balanced: pause only for structural blockers.

---

# Boundary Runtime Query

## Summary

Defines boundary-audit detail, runtime safety essentials, and query correctness
requirements.

---

## Rule: Boundary, Runtime, and Query Correctness
**Rule ID:** rid-boundary-runtime-query  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Ensure implementation output is safe at architecture and runtime
levels.

### Requirement

- Boundary audit must enforce all canonical restrictions, including alias paths
  when aliases are used.
- `ui/**` must not import `features/**`, `api/**`, `store/**`, `pages/**`.
- `api/**` must not import React/UI/features/pages/store.
- `features/**` must not import `pages/**`.
- `pages/**` must not import canonical endpoint layer directly.
- Do not fetch outside canonical endpoint layer.
- Prevent domain terms in shared UI component/file naming.
- Runtime safety essentials when server data is involved:
  - handle loading state
  - handle error state
  - handle empty state for collection/list views
  - avoid unhandled promise rejections
  - avoid fire-and-forget fetch in UI layers
- Query correctness when server-state caching exists:
  - stable query keys
  - correct invalidation/cache updates after mutations
  - avoid duplicating server-state in global store unless explicitly justified
  - keep retry behavior intentional (small capped retries for transient query
    failures; no automatic mutation retries unless explicitly required)

### Forbidden

- Accepting outputs with unresolved boundary violations.
- Accepting outputs that skip required runtime state handling.
- Duplicating server-state into store without explicit justification.

### Notes

- Record failures in `validation_summary` and return `blocked` when mandatory.

---

# Stop Conditions

## Summary

Defines hard stop/revise conditions before output finalization.

---

## Rule: Stop and Revise Conditions
**Rule ID:** rid-stop-conditions  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_implementation_discipline  
**Rationale:** Prevent knowingly non-compliant output from being emitted.

### Requirement

- Stop and revise plan/output if implementation would require:
  - domain knowledge inside shared `ui/**`
  - endpoint fetch outside canonical endpoint layer
  - leaky shared-composite generalization beyond safe thresholds
  - touched files exceeding 400 lines without extraction/split path
  - touched files exceeding 600 lines at all
- If blocked due to unresolved stop conditions, return `blocked` state with
  explicit required fixes.
- If stop condition is caused by missing mandatory context, return
  `dependency_error` instead of `blocked`.

### Forbidden

- Proceeding with known stop-condition violations.
- Hiding stop-condition violations as warnings-only output.

### Notes

- Stop conditions are hard gates, not advisory guidance.
