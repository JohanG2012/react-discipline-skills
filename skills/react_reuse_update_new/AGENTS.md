## Overview
This document defines the authoritative rules for agents/LLMs using the `react_reuse_update_new` skill.

Key constraints:
- Follow `agent_policy_v1` unless explicitly overridden by an allowed migration strategy.
- If a rule references a rule ID, the rule ID must be followed exactly.

## Rule index
- rru-overview-scope
- rru-process
- rru-output

# Overview

## Summary

This document defines the authoritative rules for the `react_reuse_update_new` skill.

This skill operates under:
- `agent_policy_v1` (mandatory baseline policy)

All rules defined here are binding for agents and LLMs using this skill.

---

## Rule: Skill Scope Definition
**Rule ID:** rru-overview-scope  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_reuse_update_new  
**Rationale:** Ensures reuse decisions stay within defined responsibilities.

### Requirement

- The skill must evaluate reuse vs update vs new for existing code.
- The skill must avoid over-generalization of components.
- The skill must prefer minimal churn and clear ownership.

### Forbidden

- Introducing large refactors unrelated to the request.
- Forcing reuse through leaky flags.

### Notes

- Use the decision ladder to guide outcomes.

---

# Reuse Decision Process

## Summary
Defines how to evaluate reuse, update, or new creation.

---

## Rule: Decision Ladder
**Rule ID:** rru-process  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_reuse_update_new  
**Rationale:** Keeps decisions consistent and bounded.

### Requirement

- Search for existing implementations before proposing new ones.
- Evaluate complexity, coupling, and divergence risks.
- Document why reuse or update was accepted or rejected.

### Forbidden

- Skipping discovery of existing code.
- Creating new modules without justification.

### Notes

- Favor reuse when behavior matches without extra mode flags.

---

# Output Contract

## Summary
Defines the expected output structure for reuse decisions.

---

## Rule: Structured Decision Output
**Rule ID:** rru-output  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_reuse_update_new  
**Rationale:** Ensures decisions are actionable and traceable.

### Requirement

- Output must state reuse/update/new for each relevant artifact.
- Output must include short reasons for each decision.
- Output must list any risks or constraints.

### Forbidden

- Output that hides the decision rationale.
- Ambiguous decisions without clear action.

### Notes

- Keep notes concise and focused on material tradeoffs.
