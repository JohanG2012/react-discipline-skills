## Overview
This document defines the authoritative rules for agents/LLMs using the `react_placement_and_layering` skill.

Key constraints:
- Follow `agent-policy-v1` unless explicitly overridden by an allowed migration strategy.
- If a rule references a rule ID, the rule ID must be followed exactly.

## Rule index
- rpl-overview-scope
- rpl-process
- rpl-output

# Overview

## Summary

This document defines the authoritative rules for the `react_placement_and_layering` skill.

This skill operates under:
- `agent-policy-v1` (mandatory baseline policy)

All rules defined here are binding for agents and LLMs using this skill.

---

## Rule: Skill Scope Definition
**Rule ID:** rpl-overview-scope  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_placement_and_layering  
**Rationale:** Ensures placement decisions stay within boundaries.

### Requirement

- The skill must map work to the correct layer and folder.
- The skill must use architecture detection outputs as inputs.
- The skill must justify placement with boundary rules.
- The skill must inherit and enforce shared baseline constraints from
  `agent-policy-v1`.

### Forbidden

- Creating new layers without explicit approval.
- Ignoring existing architectural conventions.
- Defining local mandatory rules that conflict with `agent-policy-v1`.

### Notes

- If placement is ambiguous, list options and preferred choice.

---

# Placement Process

## Summary
Defines the placement workflow for new or updated files.

---

## Rule: Layer Mapping
**Rule ID:** rpl-process  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_placement_and_layering  
**Rationale:** Keeps placement decisions consistent and testable.

### Requirement

- Map requested changes to a single owning layer.
- Prefer reuse of existing folders over creating new ones.
- Document why adjacent layers were not chosen.

### Forbidden

- Splitting a single responsibility across multiple layers.
- Introducing inconsistent naming conventions.

### Notes

- Use deterministic defaults when choices are otherwise equivalent.

---

# Output Contract

## Summary
Defines the expected output structure for placement decisions.

---

## Rule: Structured Placement Output
**Rule ID:** rpl-output  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_placement_and_layering  
**Rationale:** Ensures decisions are traceable and actionable.

### Requirement

- Output must list planned file touches with paths.
- Output must include layer justification notes.
- Output must mark reuse/update/new decisions.

### Forbidden

- Vague placement guidance without concrete paths.
- Omitting justification for layer selection.

### Notes

- Keep notes concise and tied to the request.
