## Overview
This document defines the authoritative rules for agents/LLMs using the `react_placement_and_layering` skill.

Key constraints:
- Follow `agent-policy-v1` unless explicitly overridden by an allowed migration strategy.
- If a rule references a rule ID, the rule ID must be followed exactly.

# Overview

## Summary

This document defines the authoritative rules for the `react_placement_and_layering` skill.

This skill operates under:
- `agent-policy-v1` (mandatory baseline policy)

All rules defined here are binding for agents and LLMs using this skill.

---

## Rule: Skill Scope Definition
**Rule ID:** rpl-overview-scope  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_placement_and_layering  
**Rationale:** Ensures placement decisions stay within boundaries.

### Requirement

- The skill must map work to the correct layer and folder.
- The skill must use architecture detection outputs as inputs.
- The skill must justify placement with boundary rules.
- The skill must inherit and enforce shared baseline constraints from
  `agent-policy-v1`.
- The skill must validate required inputs before planning.
- The skill must return strict machine-consumable JSON output only.
- The skill must keep output structural and exclude raw source snippets and
  secret-like values.

### Forbidden

- Creating new layers without explicit approval.
- Ignoring existing architectural conventions.
- Defining local mandatory rules that conflict with `agent-policy-v1`.
- Producing best-effort plans from missing or invalid required inputs.
- Returning unstructured prose output outside the output contract.

### Notes

- If placement is ambiguous, list options and preferred choice in contract
  fields only.

---

# Placement Process

## Summary
Defines the placement workflow for new or updated files.

---

## Rule: Layer Mapping
**Rule ID:** rpl-process  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_placement_and_layering  
**Rationale:** Keeps placement decisions consistent and testable.

### Requirement

- Validate required inputs before planning:
  - implementation request
  - target architecture rules
  - architecture-detection result
- Translate the request into explicit planning requirements before choosing
  files.
- Select one primary feature owner for the run.
- Select one strategy for the run (`follow-existing`,
  `introduce-boundaries`, or `migrate-as-you-touch`).
- Enforce import guardrails before finalizing:
  - `ui/**` must not import from `features/**`, `api/**`, `store/**`, or
    `pages/**`
  - `api/**` must not import React, `ui/**`, `features/**`, `pages/**`, or
    `store/**`
  - `lib/**` must not import React
  - `features/**` must not import from `pages/**`
  - `pages/**` must not import from the canonical endpoint layer directly; use
    feature hooks
  - `hooks/**` must not import from `features/**`, `pages/**`, or `store/**`;
    imports from `api/**` are allowed only when documented in exactly one
    canonical policy location
  - fetching/transport must remain in the canonical endpoint layer for the task
  - when a path alias exists (for example `@/`), apply guardrails to alias and
    raw `src/**` paths equally
- Map requested changes to a single owning layer per artifact.
- Perform required repository lookup before proposing new artifacts:
  - existing route files
  - existing feature sections
  - existing UI composites/primitives
  - existing endpoint/DTO files
  - existing store slices
  - naming/export conventions
- Prefer reuse of existing folders over creating new ones.
- Apply action decision ladder per artifact:
  - `reuse` when a suitable artifact already exists as-is
  - `update` when small extension of an existing artifact is enough
  - `create` only when reuse/update is not suitable
- Produce explicit artifact records with purpose, action, layer, and path.
- For architecture/repository concern conflicts:
  - use architecture detection as default source and do not recompute gravity
  - if architecture confidence is below `0.7` and impact is structural, trigger
    clean pause protocol and, after explicit resolution, select repository
    evidence with `resolution_mode=pause_resolved`
  - for all other conflict cases, keep architecture detection as the effective
    source
  - after explicit resolution, record each concern in
    `source_of_truth_resolutions`
- Keep a concise authoritative-home map for the run and use it consistently for
  placement decisions (`authoritative_home_map`).
- If no path alias is already configured, keep relative imports and do not
  introduce alias configuration unless explicitly requested.
- Include decision explanation metadata with detected architecture signals and
  chosen direction.
- Document why adjacent layers were not chosen.
- If move/rename operations are explicitly enabled, include `old_path ->
  new_path` and import-update targets before finalizing.
- In move-enabled runs, keep moves small (default: three files or fewer) and
  keep moves scoped to one concern in the run.

### Forbidden

- Splitting a single responsibility across multiple layers.
- Introducing inconsistent naming conventions.
- Emitting placement artifacts without a selected strategy and owner.
- Finalizing a plan when guardrail violations remain unresolved.
- Creating new artifacts when a clearly suitable reusable artifact already
  exists.
- Recomputing gravity independently from architecture-detection output.
- Applying repository-evidence override without explicit pause resolution when
  structural impact is present.
- Emitting move/rename plans without explicit import-update targets.

### Notes

- Use deterministic defaults when choices are otherwise equivalent.
- If non-structural ambiguity remains after lookup, choose the safest minimal
  artifact and record the ambiguity in notes.
- If structural ambiguity remains unresolved, pause and request confirmation.

# Output Contract

## Summary
Defines the expected output structure for placement decisions.

---

## Rule: Structured Placement Output
**Rule ID:** rpl-output  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react_placement_and_layering  
**Rationale:** Ensures decisions are traceable and actionable.

### Requirement

- Output must be one JSON object that follows a strict versioned contract.
- Successful placement results must use `result_type=plan`.
- Invalid or missing required inputs must use `result_type=validation_error`.
- `result_type=plan` output must include:
  - `schema_version`
  - `skill`
  - `version`
  - `strategy_used`
  - `feature_owner`
  - `canonical_endpoint_layer`
  - `authoritative_home_map`
  - `artifacts`
  - `layer_justifications`
  - `decision_explanation`
  - `import_guardrails`
  - `source_of_truth_resolutions`
  - `validation_status`
  - `notes`
- Each artifact must include:
  - `purpose`
  - `action` (`reuse | update | create`)
  - `action_rationale`
  - `layer`
  - `path`
  - `depends_on` (when relevant)
- `source_of_truth_resolutions` entries must include:
  - `concern`
  - `default_source`
  - `architecture_confidence`
  - `override_threshold`
  - `effective_source`
  - `resolution_mode` (`inherited | pause_resolved`)
  - `resolution_reason`
- `layer_justifications` must provide at least one concise rationale per touched
  layer.
- `decision_explanation` must summarize detected architecture signals and the
  chosen direction.
- `authoritative_home_map` must provide a concise map of current authoritative
  homes for relevant concerns (for example `ui`, `api`, `domain`, `routing`).
- If move/rename operations are present, output must include
  `move_operations[]` with `old_path`, `new_path`, and `import_update_targets`,
  plus `move_concern`.
- `move_operations[]` must contain three items or fewer.
- `notes` must remain concise with maximum 5 items.
- `notes` and artifact rationales must be structural (planning metadata only).
- `result_type=validation_error` output must include:
  - `schema_version`
  - `skill`
  - `version`
  - `result_type`
  - `validation_status` (`is_valid=false`, `stage=input-validation`, and at
    least one error)
  - `notes`
- `result_type=validation_error` must not include plan fields (`strategy_used`,
  `feature_owner`, `canonical_endpoint_layer`, `authoritative_home_map`,
  `artifacts`,
  `layer_justifications`, `decision_explanation`, `import_guardrails`,
  `source_of_truth_resolutions`, `move_operations`, `move_concern`).

### Forbidden

- Vague placement guidance without concrete paths.
- Omitting justification for layer selection.
- Returning free-form prose outside JSON output.
- Returning plan output that omits mandatory contract fields.
- Returning validation-error output without explicit input-validation errors.
- Returning output fields with raw source snippets or secret-like values.
- Using `effective_source=repository_evidence` for structural conflicts without
  `resolution_mode=pause_resolved`.

### Notes

- Keep notes concise and tied to the request.
