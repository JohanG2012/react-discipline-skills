# React Placement and Layering — Agent Rule Index

## Overview
This document defines the authoritative lookup index for agents/LLMs using the `react-placement-and-layering` skill.

Shared baseline policy is materialized per skill in `./.shared-rules/` to keep this skill portable when installed standalone.

Read behavior:
- `inline` rules are embedded below and must be treated as always-on guidance.
- `reference` rules are listed in the index; load them from their source file when relevant.

Inline rules in this document: 4.

## Inline Rules
#### Source: `.shared-rules/60_output_discipline.md`

### Rule: Output and Planning Discipline
**Rule ID:** sr-output-discipline  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline, react-refactoring-progression  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Keeps downstream planning and implementation outputs consistent,
compact, and reviewable.
**Covers:** Output and Planning Discipline.
**Index mode:** inline

### Requirement

- Planning outputs must include:
  - File touch plan (`Create`/`Update`/`Reuse` with paths).
  - Layer justification.
  - Reuse decision notes (`reuse as-is`, `updated`, `new`).
  - A short decision explanation that states detected architecture signals and
    chosen direction.
- Planning outputs must use a machine-readable JSON object with:
  - `output_mode` (`human|agent`)
  - `presentation.user_markdown` (prettified summary of the payload)
  - `notes[]` limited to 5 items
- Resolve `output_mode` precedence and display behavior via
  `sr-output-mode-resolution`.
- The full JSON payload is always produced for both `output_mode` values.
- If `output_mode=human`, print/display only `presentation.user_markdown` to the human.
- If `output_mode=human`, do not print/display raw JSON, envelope fields, or any payload field other than `presentation.user_markdown`.
- If `output_mode=agent`, print/display the full JSON payload.
- Implementation output must:
  - Use changed snippets for updated files by default.
  - Use unified diff when edits are scattered across non-adjacent regions.
  - Use full content for new files.

### Forbidden

- Full existing-file dumps unless explicitly requested or file is small and
  fully changed.
- Unstructured narrative-only planning outputs.
- Omitting `presentation.user_markdown` from output payloads.
- Selecting `output_mode=agent` by habit/default when a human-invoked run does
  not explicitly request machine-readable output.

### Rule: Mega-File Safety Checks and Output Contract
**Rule ID:** sr-mega-file-validation-output  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline, react-refactoring-progression  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Enforces post-step safety evidence and deterministic output
shape.
**Covers:** Mega-File Safety Checks and Output Contract.
**Index mode:** inline

### Requirement

- After each extraction step, verify:
  - TypeScript still compiles (or would compile under existing config),
  - imports remain boundary-compliant,
  - anchor public API (props/exports) is unchanged unless explicitly requested,
  - no runtime behavior change unless requested,
  - tests are updated only when behavior changes and suite exists.
- Output when triggered must include:
  - phased A->D plan with file-touch list per phase,
  - declaration: `in_cap_minimal_reduction` (default) or
    `scope_expansion_needed`,
  - implementation preference: unified diff for mega anchor edits and full
    content for newly extracted files.
- Keep extraction anti-churn constraints explicit:
  - no `shared/common` dumping-ground creation,
  - no new domain logic in `ui/**`,
  - no fetching outside canonical endpoint layer,
  - no broad formatting-only churn,
  - no new mode/flag matrices to force reuse,
  - no new barrels where local area does not already use barrels.

### Forbidden

- Skipping required safety checks after extraction steps.
- Returning mega-file plan output without phased touches and plan declaration.
- Introducing anti-churn violations under mega-file triage scope.

### Rule: Output Mode Resolution and Display Safety
**Rule ID:** sr-output-mode-resolution  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline, react-refactoring-progression  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Prevents accidental machine-mode output to humans and enforces
deterministic mode selection.
**Covers:** Output Mode Resolution and Display Safety.
**Index mode:** inline

### Requirement

- Resolve `output_mode` using strict precedence:
  1. if request explicitly sets `output_mode`, honor it,
  2. else if requester explicitly asks for machine-readable/raw JSON output
     (automation/integration intent), set `output_mode=agent`,
  3. else if a human explicitly asks to run/use the skill, set
     `output_mode=human`,
  4. else default to `output_mode=agent`.
- Ambiguity fallback:
  - when uncertain between human and agent, choose `output_mode=human`.
- Display contract remains strict:
  - if `output_mode=human`, display only `presentation.user_markdown`,
  - if `output_mode=agent`, display full JSON payload.
- A human-invoked skill run must not infer automation intent unless the human
  explicitly requests machine-readable output.

### Forbidden

- Selecting `output_mode=agent` by habit/default when a human explicitly
  requested skill usage and did not request machine-readable output.
- Inferring automation intent without explicit signal from the request context.
- Displaying raw JSON to a human when `output_mode=human`.
