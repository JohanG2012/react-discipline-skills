# Overview

## Summary

This document defines the authoritative rules for the `agent-policy-v1` skill.

This skill operates under:
- `agent-policy-v1` (mandatory baseline policy)

All rules defined here are binding for agents and LLMs using this skill.

---

## Rule: Skill Scope Definition
**Rule ID:** apv-overview-scope  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Ensures the policy skill stays focused on governance and scope.

### Requirement

- The skill must operate only within its defined responsibility.
- The skill must not perform responsibilities assigned to other skills.
- The skill must not reinterpret or override policy without explicit approval.
- The shared baseline must apply uniformly to:
  - `react-architecture-detection`
  - `react-placement-and-layering`
  - `react-reuse-update-new`
  - `react-implementation-discipline`
- The production execution skill set for this initiative is fixed to those four
  skills; `agent-policy-v1` is shared baseline policy and not a production
  execution skill.
- Shared policy/config updates must not be modeled as new execution skills.
- Document precedence must remain deterministic:
  - `specs/001-agent-policy-v1/master_spec.md` is authoritative.
  - Supporting policy docs may fill non-conflicting open details only.
- The shared baseline must explicitly govern:
  - Architecture/dependency boundaries.
  - Deterministic defaults and pause behavior.
  - Scope-governor limits and expansion protocol.
  - Output consistency for planning and implementation.
  - Ownership/naming conventions and completion checks.

### Forbidden

- Expanding scope beyond the Scope Governor without explicit override.
- Introducing implicit changes to repository structure.
- Creating competing policy sources that conflict with shared baseline precedence.
- Adding new production execution skills without explicit scope/constitution
  update.

---

## Rule: Baseline Non-goals
**Rule ID:** apv-overview-nongoals  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Prevents policy drift into implementation-specific prescriptions.

### Requirement

- Shared policy must define constraints and governance, not implementation
  recipes.
- Shared policy must not implicitly change through examples, migration behavior,
  or downstream reinterpretation.
- Downstream skills may add local guidance only when it does not conflict with
  shared mandatory rules.

### Forbidden

- Treating examples as policy overrides.
- Introducing stack/framework mandates as shared-policy requirements without
  explicit spec approval.

### Notes

- If uncertainty affects governance decisions, pause and request clarification.

---

# Policy Constraints

## Summary
Defines non-negotiable scope and cap controls for downstream skill work.

---

## Rule: Minimal Scope Enforcement
**Rule ID:** apv-constraints  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Prevents uncontrolled scope expansion and dependency creep.

### Requirement

- Changes must stay within the requested feature scope.
- New top-level folders must not be added without explicit approval.
- New dependencies must not be added without explicit approval.
- `pre_approved_collisions` must exist only in shared baseline header and be
  empty unless explicitly approved in a future version.
- When work appears to exceed scope caps, deliver the smallest viable in-cap
  result and provide a structured follow-up scope list.

### Forbidden

- Silent expansion of scope.
- Introducing unapproved dependencies or repositories.
- Defining downstream-local collision registries.
- Mixing structural migration moves with feature behavior work unless explicitly
  requested.

### Notes

- If a requirement cannot be met without expanding scope, pause and request
  approval.

---

## Rule: Scope Governor Hard Defaults
**Rule ID:** apv-scope-governor  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Controls churn and keeps delivery bounded.

### Requirement

- Hard defaults (unless explicitly overridden):
  - Max files touched: `8`
  - Max new files: `4`
  - Max moved/renamed files: `0` (unless migration mode explicitly enabled)
  - Max new dependencies: `0`
  - Max new top-level folders: `0`
- When caps are exceeded, provide a structured scope expansion request with
  concrete `why` and `would_touch` fields, while still delivering an in-cap
  result.

### Forbidden

- Exceeding hard defaults silently.
- Expanding dependency or top-level folder scope without explicit approval.

---

# Governance

## Summary
Sets expectations for compliance, documentation, and review.

---

## Rule: Governance Compliance
**Rule ID:** apv-governance  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Ensures policies are enforced consistently across changes.

### Requirement

- All changes must be validated against the constitution and project specs.
- Documentation updates must keep guidance accurate and current.
- Generated artifacts must be produced by the official build process.
- Shared-policy rule changes must include an explicit policy version increment
  with documented rationale.
- Shared-policy exception approvals must be performed by repo maintainers only.
- Exception records must include rationale and conflicting rule reference.
- Exception records must not include expiry metadata; approved exceptions remain
  active until explicitly revoked or superseded by newer policy version.
- `pre_approved_collisions` must be managed only in the shared baseline header.
- Policy behavior must not be changed implicitly via examples, migration
  behavior, or downstream reinterpretation.

### Forbidden

- Bypassing validation requirements.
- Manual edits to generated artifacts.
- Approving shared-policy exceptions from non-maintainer roles.
- Adding expiry fields to shared-policy exception records.
- Defining downstream-local `pre_approved_collisions` sources.
- Changing shared-policy semantics without a version and rationale update.

### Notes

- If governance rules conflict, the constitution takes precedence.

---

# Architecture Boundaries

## Summary
Defines shared architecture and dependency-boundary rules all downstream skills
must enforce.

---

## Rule: Architecture and Dependency Boundaries
**Rule ID:** apv-architecture-boundaries  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Ensures all downstream skills enforce one consistent
architecture and import-boundary model.

### Requirement

- The following non-negotiables must be enforced:
  - Do not create new folders unless explicitly allowed by policy or user
    instruction.
  - Never place domain business logic in `ui/**` or `api/**`.
  - Never fetch outside the canonical endpoint layer
    (`api/endpoints/**` or gravity-equivalent API home).
  - Prefer small, composable changes over large refactors.
  - Avoid `shared/` or `common/` dumping-ground patterns.
- Dependency direction must remain consistent with the baseline:
  - `ui/**` must not import `features/**`, `api/**`, `store/**`, or `pages/**`.
  - `api/**` must not import React, `ui/**`, `features/**`, `pages/**`, or
    `store/**`.
  - `features/**` must not import `pages/**`.
  - `pages/**` must not import canonical endpoint modules directly.
  - `hooks/**` must not import `features/**`, `pages/**`, or `store/**`; imports
    from `api/**` are allowed only when documented in exactly one canonical
    policy location.
- The canonical endpoint layer must be determined once per task by Architecture
  Detection and reused consistently in boundary checks for that task.
- If a path alias exists (for example `@/`), all boundary rules apply equally to
  alias imports and raw `src/**` imports.
- Generic fetch-hook exceptions are valid only when documented in exactly one
  canonical policy location; multiple policy locations invalidate the exception.
- No second home may be introduced for the same concern (UI/API/store/routing)
  unless explicit migration scope is approved.

### Forbidden

- Competing homes for the same concern in the same scope.
- Domain terms in reusable `ui/**` component file names.
- DTO-to-domain mapping in `api/**`.

### Notes

- Architecture Detection owns gravity decisions; downstream skills inherit those
  decisions unless a valid pause is triggered.

---

# Ownership and Naming

## Summary
Defines shared ownership boundaries and naming conventions for downstream skill
specifications.

---

## Rule: Ownership and Naming Contract
**Rule ID:** apv-ownership-naming  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Keeps responsibility boundaries and naming deterministic across
all downstream specs.

### Requirement

- `pages/**` remain thin route orchestrators.
- `features/**` own domain behavior, feature hooks, and domain mapping.
- `ui/primitives/**` and `ui/composites/**` stay domain-agnostic.
- `api/**` stays transport-only and returns DTOs or normalized errors.
- `store/**` is global client-state only; do not mirror server-state without
  explicit justification.
- Naming conventions must remain deterministic:
  - `*Page.tsx` for pages.
  - `*Section.tsx` for feature sections.
  - `use*.ts` for hooks.
  - `*.dto.ts` and `*Dto` for DTOs.
- Naming and exports must remain searchable and consistent:
  - Prefer matching file/export names.
  - Prefer named exports unless framework conventions require default exports.
  - Avoid introducing barrel files unless the local area already uses them
    consistently.

### Forbidden

- Domain mode flags in shared composites.
- Introducing new naming schemes when local patterns are clear.
- API transport concerns in UI or generic hook layers.
- Mixed synonym vocabularies for the same role in the same scope (for example
  mixing `Page` and `Route` naming without existing convention).

---

# Decision Defaults and Pause Rules

## Summary
Defines deterministic default behavior and high-impact clarification triggers.

---

## Rule: Deterministic Defaults and Pause Protocol
**Rule ID:** apv-decision-defaults  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Reduces unnecessary clarification loops while protecting
high-impact structural decisions.

### Requirement

- Use deterministic defaults for non-structural ambiguity.
- Pause only when both are true:
  - `confidence < 0.7`
  - `impact = structural`
- Structural impact includes top-level structure changes, competing concern
  homes, dependency-direction changes, cross-layer moves, global state strategy
  changes, or scope-cap violations.
- When pausing, use clean pause protocol:
  - State ambiguity clearly.
  - Present 2-3 options.
  - Recommend a default.
  - Wait for confirmation.
- Use `balanced` pause mode by default unless explicitly configured otherwise.
- Do not pause for minor decisions when a safe default exists.

### Forbidden

- Proceeding on structural ambiguity without pause.
- Repeated low-value questions when a safe deterministic default exists.
- Vague, non-blocking, or style-only clarification questions that do not change
  structural outcomes.

---

# Output and Planning Discipline

## Summary
Defines required output structure for planning and implementation guidance.

---

## Rule: Output and Planning Discipline
**Rule ID:** apv-output-discipline  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Keeps downstream planning and implementation outputs consistent,
compact, and reviewable.

### Requirement

- Planning outputs must include:
  - File touch plan (`Create`/`Update`/`Reuse` with paths).
  - Layer justification.
  - Reuse decision notes (`reuse as-is`, `updated`, `new`).
  - A short decision explanation that states detected architecture signals and
    chosen direction.
- Planning outputs must use a machine-readable JSON object with `notes[]`
  limited to 5 items.
- Implementation output must:
  - Use changed snippets for updated files by default.
  - Use unified diff when edits are scattered across non-adjacent regions.
  - Use full content for new files.

### Forbidden

- Full existing-file dumps unless explicitly requested or file is small and
  fully changed.
- Unstructured narrative-only planning outputs.

---

# Completion and Quality Baseline

## Summary
Defines mandatory completion checks and runtime-safety expectations inherited by
all downstream skills.

---

## Rule: Completion and Quality Baseline
**Rule ID:** apv-dod-baseline  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Ensures every downstream skill validates critical correctness and
safety gates before completion.

### Requirement

- Boundary audit must pass:
  - No forbidden imports by layer.
  - No fetching outside canonical endpoint layer.
  - `api/**` remains transport-only.
- Runtime safety baseline:
  - Loading state handling when server data is involved.
  - Error state handling.
  - Empty state handling for list/collection views.
  - No unhandled promise rejections.
- Minimal churn baseline:
  - Touch only planned files unless deviations are explained.
  - Avoid unrelated refactors.
- If tooling exists, applicable checks must pass (`tsc`, lint, and existing test
  suites relevant to changed behavior).
- If TanStack Query (or equivalent) is used, query correctness checks must
  ensure stable keys, intended invalidation, and justified server-state/store
  boundaries.
- Tests are required only when a suite already exists and changed behavior falls
  within that suite's scope.

### Forbidden

- Marking work done without boundary/safety checks.
- Treating optional quality checks as mandatory when repository tooling does not
  exist.
- Claiming compliance while skipping available type/lint checks in repositories
  that provide those checks.

---

# Planning and Reuse Workflow

## Summary
Defines required pre-implementation workflow and reuse decision discipline for
all downstream skills.

---

## Rule: Planning and Reuse Workflow
**Rule ID:** apv-planning-reuse  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Prevents ad hoc implementation choices and improves consistency
across downstream planning outputs.

### Requirement

- Before implementation, downstream skills must:
  - Classify request type (feature, route/page, API integration, refactor, bug
    fix).
  - Choose a domain owner.
  - Map affected layers.
  - Identify expected data sources.
  - Decide server/local/global state ownership.
  - Decide UI reuse shape (reuse/update/new).
  - List planned file touches.
- Existing implementations must be searched before creating new modules in:
  - Feature/domain modules.
  - UI primitives/composites.
  - API endpoints/DTOs.
  - State patterns.
- Reuse decisions must follow the ladder:
  - Reuse as-is.
  - Update existing (small, clean extension).
  - Create new (when reuse would leak domain concerns or force excessive
    complexity).
- For shared composites, if reuse requires too many domain-specific options,
  prefer feature-level duplication instead of adding domain mode flags.
- Reuse evaluation should weigh complexity cost, coupling risk, divergence
  probability, and locality benefit.

### Forbidden

- Creating new modules without checking existing alternatives.
- Skipping explicit reuse/update/new decision capture.
- Forcing domain behavior into reusable shared composites.

---

# Migration and Placement Strategy

## Summary
Defines migration-aware placement rules and strategy selection constraints.

---

## Rule: Migration and Placement Strategy
**Rule ID:** apv-migration-placement  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Prevents mixed-architecture drift and keeps placement decisions
deterministic in legacy or evolving repositories.

### Requirement

- Do not introduce parallel architectures for the same concern.
- Choose a strategy per change:
  - Follow existing.
  - Introduce target structure at boundaries.
  - Migrate as you touch (explicit migration scope only).
- Default balanced behavior:
  - No moves/renames unless explicitly enabled.
  - Introduce new homes only when isolated and non-competing.
  - Keep feature behavior and structural migration separate unless explicitly
    requested.
- Gravity decisions from Architecture Detection are inherited by downstream
  skills and must not be recomputed unless pause/escalation resolves a conflict.
- If move mode is explicitly enabled, keep moves small and complete import
  updates in the same change.

### Forbidden

- Two active homes for the same concern in one scope.
- Mixing broad structural migration with unrelated behavior changes.
- Recomputing gravity independently in downstream skills without escalation.

---

# Fallback Technology Defaults

## Summary
Defines shared fallback defaults used only when repository conventions are
missing or ambiguous.

---

## Rule: Fallback Technology Defaults
**Rule ID:** apv-fallback-defaults  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Ensures deterministic cross-skill defaults while honoring
existing repository gravity first.

### Requirement

- Existing repository stack/conventions take precedence over fallback defaults.
- If no clear convention exists, defaults are:
  - Server-state: TanStack Query; keep transport in `api/endpoints/**`.
  - Client-state: local-first; global store only when truly global.
  - Routing: React Router for plain React; framework-native routing when
    framework is detected.
  - Styling: follow existing; Tailwind default only for greenfield.
  - Forms: react-hook-form.
  - Validation: Zod at boundaries (DTO/form), with domain schema ownership in
    feature domain layers.
  - HTTP client: native `fetch` via shared wrapper; normalized `ApiError`;
    conservative retry posture.
  - Build tool: Vite for greenfield plain React unless existing conventions say
    otherwise.
  - Date/localization: native `Date` and `Intl` unless domain needs justify
    more.
  - Identifier strategy: string IDs by default.

### Forbidden

- Introducing competing stack choices mid-repository without explicit request.
- Mirroring server-state into global store without explicit justification.

---

# Implementation Defaults

## Summary
Defines shared implementation posture defaults inherited by downstream skills.

---

## Rule: Implementation Defaults
**Rule ID:** apv-implementation-defaults  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Aligns downstream implementation behavior on quality, environment
access, logging, and tooling posture.

### Requirement

- Feature flags must be centralized in `config/featureFlags.ts` and evaluated at
  composition boundaries.
- Reusable UI components should support class extension patterns consistently
  (for example `className` with shared merge helper where applicable).
- Accessibility baseline is required for reusable UI.
- Performance posture is readability-first; memoization optimizations require
  concrete justification.
- Repository topology must be detected (single-app vs monorepo) and rules
  applied per app root when monorepo signals exist.
- Module-boundary tooling posture is spec-first:
  - Start with import-boundary review checks.
  - Add lint/tool enforcement only when explicitly requested as dedicated
    hardening scope.
  - Mirror alias paths in boundary lint rules when aliases are present.
- Environment access must be centralized through `config/env.ts`.
- Logging should use shared logger abstractions; avoid committed debug logging.
- Codegen is opt-in only; default to handwritten endpoint/DTO ownership.
- Storybook/docs are optional and should follow existing setup when present.

### Forbidden

- Direct environment reads outside `config/env.ts`.
- Committing `console.log`/`console.debug` in production code paths.
- Introducing codegen or docs platforms as implicit scope expansion.
- Adding boundary/tooling stacks implicitly in routine feature scope.

---

# Layer Contracts

## Summary
Defines shared folder-layer contracts and cross-layer error handling ownership.

---

## Rule: Layer Contracts and Error Ownership
**Rule ID:** apv-layer-contracts  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Keeps ownership deterministic across pages, features, UI, API,
store, core, hooks, lib, and config.

### Requirement

- `pages/**` are route orchestrators and must not fetch directly from canonical
  endpoint modules.
- `features/**` own domain logic, feature hooks, and DTO-to-domain mapping.
- `ui/**` remains domain-agnostic and transport-agnostic.
- `api/**` remains transport-only with DTO ownership and normalized error
  outputs.
- `store/**` is global client-state only; server-state source of truth remains
  query cache.
- `core/**` composes providers/setup rather than domain behavior.
- `hooks/**` are cross-domain generic hooks unless in feature-owned hook homes.
- `config/**` is canonical home for env and feature-flag access points.
- Cross-layer error handling follows three-stage ownership:
  - `api/endpoints/**`: normalized transport errors.
  - `features/*/hooks/**`: expose hook-level error shapes.
  - `pages/**` and `features/*/sections/**`: choose user-facing feedback.

### Forbidden

- Fetching or transport logic in page/UI layers.
- Domain logic in `ui/**` or transport mapping in `api/**`.
- UI feedback policy embedded in transport layers.

---

# Access and Write Control

## Summary
Defines shared access assumptions and write-control behavior for downstream
skills.

---

## Rule: Access and Write Control
**Rule ID:** apv-access-write-control  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Keeps structural decisions grounded in repository signals and
maintains controlled, reviewable changes.

### Requirement

- Detection/reuse/planning stages require repository read/search access.
- Minimum capabilities include:
  - Listing relevant file trees.
  - Searching code patterns.
  - Reading source/config files on demand.
- If direct access is unavailable, require a fallback context bundle with file
  tree, package/tooling config, router entry, API home, and representative
  module examples.
- Default write posture must be controlled and reviewable.
- If direct writes are enabled, scope-governor and minimal-churn rules still
  apply.
- Architecture/specification document edits require explicit request and must be
  treated as dedicated documentation scope.

### Forbidden

- Structural placement decisions without repository signal checks.
- Silent broad writes that bypass scope and review controls.
- Auto-editing architecture/spec documents during regular implementation work.

---

# File Size Guidance

## Summary
Defines soft file-size and responsibility guidance to prevent oversized modules.

---

## Rule: File Size and Responsibility Guidance
**Rule ID:** apv-file-size-guidance  
**Priority:** SHOULD  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Encourages maintainable module boundaries and limits
responsibility drift.

### Requirement

- Treat folder-specific line limits as soft caps, not hard compile gates.
- Prefer responsibility-based splitting when files become hard to reason about.
- Use practical warning signals:
  - Around 400 lines: architecture smell.
  - Around 600+ lines: refactor strongly recommended.
- Favor this practical rule: no file should require more than about three screen
  heights to understand its primary responsibility.

### Forbidden

- Ignoring clear multi-responsibility smells in oversized files.

---

# Architecture Detection Contract

## Summary
Defines the shared contract that downstream skills must inherit from
architecture-detection outputs, including bootstrap behavior.

---

## Rule: Architecture Detection Output and Bootstrap Contract
**Rule ID:** apv-architecture-detection-contract  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Ensures all downstream skills consume one consistent
architecture-detection result and bootstrap behavior.

### Requirement

- Architecture detection output must include the shared structural signals:
  - `routing.type`
  - `ui.home`
  - `api.home` (canonical endpoint layer for boundary checks)
  - `domain.organization`
  - `gravity_map`
  - `alignment_score`
  - `strategy`
  - `notes[]`
- Gravity decisions are owned by architecture detection and reused by all
  downstream skills within the same task.
- Downstream skills must not recompute/override gravity unless a structural
  pause is triggered and explicitly resolved.
- Bootstrap behavior applies only when no clear concern homes exist:
  - Allow folder creation only from the canonical set:
    `pages/`, `features/`, `ui/primitives/`, `ui/composites/`, `api/client/`,
    `api/dto/`, `api/endpoints/`, `core/`, `lib/`, `hooks/`, `config/`
  - `store/` may be created only when truly global client-state is required.
  - Prefer minimal bootstrap: create only folders needed for the current task.

### Forbidden

- Consuming inconsistent architecture-detection outputs across downstream skills
  for the same task.
- Creating speculative bootstrap folders not needed by the current task.

---

# Enforcement Heuristics

## Summary
Defines shared heuristics for identifying placement violations and validating
folder-fit decisions.

---

## Rule: Enforcement Heuristics
**Rule ID:** apv-enforcement-heuristics  
**Priority:** SHOULD  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Provides consistent review heuristics across downstream skills
without over-prescribing implementation details.

### Requirement

- Treat a file as likely misplaced when one or more signals appear:
  - It imports forbidden layer dependencies.
  - It contains domain terms while living in reusable `ui/**` homes.
  - It performs network fetches outside canonical endpoint modules.
  - It performs DTO-to-domain mapping inside `api/**`.
- Use a simple placement sanity map in reviews:
  - Endpoint call -> `api/endpoints/*`
  - React Query hook -> `features/<domain>/hooks/*`
  - DTO -> domain mapping -> `features/<domain>/domain|adapters/*`
  - Reusable primitives/composites -> `ui/primitives|composites/*`
  - Route orchestration -> `pages/*`
  - Shared config/env -> `config/*`

### Forbidden

- Ignoring clear layer-violation signals during conformance checks.

---

## Rule: Skill Scope Definition
**Rule ID:** rpl-overview-scope  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Rationale:** Ensures placement decisions stay within boundaries.

### Requirement

- The skill must map work to the correct layer and folder.
- The skill must use architecture detection outputs as inputs.
- The skill must justify placement with boundary rules.
- The skill must inherit and enforce shared baseline constraints from
  `agent-policy-v1`.
- The skill must validate required inputs before planning.
- The skill must return strict machine-consumable JSON output only.
- The skill must keep output structural and exclude raw source snippets and
  secret-like values.

### Forbidden

- Creating new layers without explicit approval.
- Ignoring existing architectural conventions.
- Defining local mandatory rules that conflict with `agent-policy-v1`.
- Producing best-effort plans from missing or invalid required inputs.
- Returning unstructured prose output outside the output contract.

### Notes

- If placement is ambiguous, list options and preferred choice in contract
  fields only.

# Placement Process

## Summary
Defines the placement workflow for new or updated files.

---

## Rule: Layer Mapping
**Rule ID:** rpl-process  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Rationale:** Keeps placement decisions consistent and testable.

### Requirement

- Validate required inputs before planning:
  - implementation request
  - target architecture rules
  - architecture-detection result
- Translate the request into explicit planning requirements before choosing
  files.
- Classify the request using one or more task categories before placement:
  - new page/route
  - new feature capability
  - new UI element
  - new API endpoint/backend integration
  - refactor/reuse improvement
  - bug fix
- Select one primary feature owner for the run.
- Select one strategy for the run (`follow-existing`,
  `introduce-boundaries`, or `migrate-as-you-touch`).
- Enforce import guardrails before finalizing:
  - `ui/**` must not import from `features/**`, `api/**`, `store/**`, or
    `pages/**`
  - `api/**` must not import React, `ui/**`, `features/**`, `pages/**`, or
    `store/**`
  - `lib/**` must not import React
  - `features/**` must not import from `pages/**`
  - `pages/**` must not import from the canonical endpoint layer directly; use
    feature hooks
  - `hooks/**` must not import from `features/**`, `pages/**`, or `store/**`;
    imports from `api/**` are allowed only when documented in exactly one
    canonical policy location
  - fetching/transport must remain in the canonical endpoint layer for the task
  - when a path alias exists (for example `@/`), apply guardrails to alias and
    raw `src/**` paths equally
- Enforce cross-layer error ownership in placement decisions:
  - `api/endpoints/**` owns normalized typed transport errors (`ApiError`) with
    `message` and optional `status`, `code`, `details`, and `cause`
  - `features/*/hooks/**` expose consistent error result shape and do not emit
    toasts/snackbars for query/page-load failures
  - `pages/**` and `features/*/sections/**` own user-facing error behavior;
    default query/page-load failures to inline retry UI
  - mutation toast/snackbar feedback is allowed only when that app pattern
    already exists; otherwise keep mutation feedback inline near the action
- Enforce state persistence policy when store/global-state artifacts are planned:
  - persist only user preferences and lightweight durable UI state
  - prefer URL query parameters for shareable/bookmarkable state
  - do not persist ephemeral UI state (for example modal open flags)
  - do not persist server-state snapshots in global store unless explicitly
    justified by performance-critical caching, offline-first requirements, or a
    documented architectural decision
- Map requested changes to a single owning layer per artifact.
- Perform required repository lookup before proposing new artifacts:
  - existing route files
  - existing feature sections
  - existing UI composites/primitives
  - existing endpoint/DTO files
  - existing store slices
  - naming/export conventions
- Prefer reuse of existing folders over creating new ones.
- Apply action decision ladder per artifact:
  - `reuse` when a suitable artifact already exists as-is
  - `update` when small extension of an existing artifact is enough
  - `create` only when reuse/update is not suitable
- Produce explicit artifact records with purpose, action, layer, and path.
- For architecture/repository concern conflicts:
  - use architecture detection as default source and do not recompute gravity
  - if architecture confidence is below `0.7` and impact is structural, trigger
    clean pause protocol and, after explicit resolution, select repository
    evidence with `resolution_mode=pause_resolved`
  - for all other conflict cases, keep architecture detection as the effective
    source
  - after explicit resolution, record each concern in
    `source_of_truth_resolutions`
- Preserve unresolved high-impact structural ambiguity from architecture
  detection or placement analysis and block plan finalization until
  clarification is resolved.
- Keep a concise authoritative-home map for the run and use it consistently for
  placement decisions (`authoritative_home_map`).
- If no path alias is already configured, keep relative imports and do not
  introduce alias configuration unless explicitly requested.
- Include decision explanation metadata with detected architecture signals and
  chosen direction.
- Document why adjacent layers were not chosen.
- If move/rename operations are explicitly enabled, include `old_path ->
  new_path` and import-update targets before finalizing.
- In move-enabled runs, keep moves small (default: three files or fewer) and
  keep moves scoped to one concern in the run.

### Forbidden

- Splitting a single responsibility across multiple layers.
- Introducing inconsistent naming conventions.
- Emitting placement artifacts without a selected strategy and owner.
- Finalizing a plan when guardrail violations remain unresolved.
- Creating new artifacts when a clearly suitable reusable artifact already
  exists.
- Recomputing gravity independently from architecture-detection output.
- Applying repository-evidence override without explicit pause resolution when
  structural impact is present.
- Finalizing `result_type=placement_plan` while unresolved high-impact structural
  ambiguity remains.
- Emitting move/rename plans without explicit import-update targets.

### Notes

- Use deterministic defaults when choices are otherwise equivalent.
- If non-structural ambiguity remains after lookup, choose the safest minimal
  artifact and record the ambiguity in notes.
- If structural ambiguity remains unresolved, pause and request confirmation.

# Migration Strategy and Placement Safety

## Summary
Defines migration-aware placement behavior and duplicate-home prevention.

---

## Rule: Strategy and One-Home Discipline
**Rule ID:** rpl-migration-safety  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Rationale:** Prevents parallel architectures and unsafe structural churn.

### Requirement

- Choose exactly one strategy per run:
  - `follow-existing`
  - `introduce-boundaries`
  - `migrate-as-you-touch`
- Follow gravity for each concern by extending the active home unless an
  explicit migration boundary is selected.
- Avoid duplicate homes by keeping one authoritative home per concern in the
  run (`authoritative_home_map`).
- Introduce new target structure only when the new scope is isolated,
  self-consistent, and does not create competing homes.
- Classify placement work as either:
  - feature task (default: updates/creates only, no moves), or
  - migration task (moves allowed only in explicit migration scope).
- Default move posture is no moves/renames; move operations require explicit
  enablement and complete import-update targets.
- In move-enabled runs, keep move scope bounded to one concern and three files
  or fewer.
- In bootstrap-triggered repositories (flat/ad-hoc with no clear homes), folder
  creation is limited to canonical homes and only the minimal folders needed for
  the task.
- In bootstrap mode, create `store/` only when truly global client state is
  required.

### Forbidden

- Treating two locations as simultaneously correct for the same concern.
- Introducing broad relocation/migration during routine feature-scope planning.
- Creating bootstrap folders outside canonical homes.
- Mixing feature-behavior changes with structural migration by default.

### Notes

- Prefer stable import boundaries and incremental convergence over early broad
  file moves.

---

# Deterministic Defaults and Pause Discipline

## Summary
Defines deterministic default actions and strict pause criteria for placement
decisions.

---

## Rule: Default Bias and Clean Pause Protocol
**Rule ID:** rpl-default-bias  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Rationale:** Keeps planning flow predictable while pausing only for
high-impact ambiguity.

### Requirement

- Apply deterministic defaults unless structural risk requires a pause:
  - ambiguous feature owner -> choose the most specific domain
  - UI pattern unclear -> keep logic in the feature section
  - reuse vs generalize unclear -> prefer section-level duplication
  - multiple state options -> prefer local state first
  - unsure store usage -> avoid introducing global store state
  - unsure abstraction -> keep implementation concrete
  - API placement unclear -> use the existing API home
  - folder placement unclear -> follow gravity and nearest established home
  - naming unclear -> match nearest-neighbor naming
- Pause only when both are true:
  - `confidence < 0.7`
  - impact is structural
- For low-confidence non-structural decisions, proceed with deterministic
  defaults.
- When pausing, use a clean protocol:
  1. state the structural ambiguity
  2. provide two or three bounded options
  3. provide one recommended default
  4. wait for confirmation
- Default pause mode is `balanced`; respect explicit policy overrides for
  `strict` or `autonomous` modes.

### Forbidden

- Pausing for minor naming choices, harmless small prop additions, or other
  low-impact local decisions with safe defaults.
- Asking vague or philosophical architecture questions during execution.
- Continuing with conflicting structural assumptions after deciding a pause is
  required.

### Notes

- Question quality must remain high-leverage, structural, and blocking.

---

# Discovery and Convention Fit

## Summary
Defines mandatory repository discovery and naming/export convention checks before
final placement output.

---

## Rule: Discovery Coverage and Convention Alignment
**Rule ID:** rpl-discovery-conventions  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Rationale:** Prevents duplicate artifacts and naming drift in placement plans.

### Requirement

- Discovery must check existing homes before proposing new artifacts:
  - route files/entry points
  - feature sections, hooks, and domain modules
  - UI composites and primitives
  - endpoint and DTO modules
  - store slices and state ownership patterns
  - naming/export conventions in the active area
- Naming and export checks must enforce local consistency:
  - pages: `*Page` unless framework or local conventions require otherwise
  - feature sections: `*Section`
  - hooks: `use*`
  - DTOs: `*Dto` and DTO placement in `api/dto` or the gravity-equivalent home
  - component files/exports in `PascalCase`
  - hook files/exports in `useXxx` camelCase
  - named exports by default; allow default exports only for framework-required
    modules or established local-area conventions
  - avoid introducing new barrels unless the local area already uses them
- Keep names searchable by aligning file names and primary exports.
- Use one role term per area (for example `Page` vs `Route` vs `Screen`) and do
  not mix synonyms unpredictably in one area.
- If tests exist in the target area, follow colocated naming compatibility
  (`*.test.tsx` or `*.test.ts`) for touched artifacts.
- Record concrete discovery evidence (paths) or explicit `not_found` outcomes
  before selecting `create`.

### Forbidden

- Proposing new artifact homes before discovery checks complete.
- Inventing a new naming/export style in an established area.
- Treating naming ambiguity as justification for structural churn.

### Notes

- Convention fit is part of placement correctness, not optional polish.

---

# Constraint and Scope Governor Alignment

## Summary
Defines required scope and constraint handling for placement planning.

---

## Rule: Constraint-Aware Placement Scope
**Rule ID:** rpl-scope-governor  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Rationale:** Keeps plans reviewable and prevents implicit scope expansion.

### Requirement

- Respect explicit task constraints when provided, including:
  - `avoid_new_folders`
  - `max_files_touched`
  - move/rename enablement and limits
- If explicit constraints are absent, apply shared-policy hard defaults:
  - max files touched: `8`
  - max new files: `4`
  - max moved/renamed files: `0` unless migration mode is explicit
  - max new dependencies: `0` unless explicitly requested
  - max new top-level folders: `0` unless explicitly requested
- If scope pressure exceeds caps, produce the smallest in-cap plan and record
  concise follow-up scope in `notes`.
- If extra out-of-cap scope would materially improve completeness, include a
  structured `scope_expansion_needed` array with items:
  - `why` (short reason)
  - `would_touch` (number of additional files)
- When `scope_expansion_needed` is included, still return the in-cap placement
  plan in the same output.
- If `avoid_new_folders=true`, do not propose new folder homes unless explicit
  override is provided.
- If constraints block all safe placement outcomes, return
  `result_type=validation_error` with blocking errors.

### Forbidden

- Silently exceeding explicit or default scope caps.
- Proposing new dependencies as part of normal placement planning.
- Enabling moves/renames in feature-task mode without explicit migration scope.

### Notes

- Keep scope expansion explicit and bounded; do not hide it in placement output.

---

# Access Control and Fallback Context

## Summary
Defines read/search access expectations and fallback context requirements for
placement planning.

---

## Rule: Repository Evidence Access
**Rule ID:** rpl-access-control  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Rationale:** Placement decisions require repository evidence to avoid
speculative structure changes.

### Requirement

- Placement planning should run with repository read/search access.
- Minimum capabilities expected:
  - list tree shape under `src/`
  - search architecture and data-access patterns
  - read files on demand
  - read key config/tooling files relevant to routing, API homes, and naming
- If direct repository access is unavailable, require a fallback context bundle
  before finalizing a plan:
  - file tree (top-level and `src/` depth about 3-4)
  - `package.json`
  - router entry/setup files
  - API client/home location currently in use
  - representative primitive/composite/section/hook/endpoint examples
- Without repository evidence or fallback bundle, return
  `result_type=dependency_error` and do not emit a placement plan.
- This skill remains planning-only and does not perform implementation edits.
- Default write posture is controlled/review-oriented output; avoid silent churn
  and unreviewed direct edits as routine behavior.
- Do not auto-edit architecture/specification documents during routine tasks
  (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `specs/**/master_spec.md`, `spec/**`).
- Treat architecture/specification document edits as dedicated documentation
  scope and perform them only when explicitly requested.

### Forbidden

- Finalizing structural placement without repository evidence.
- Assuming gravity/convention outcomes when both direct access and fallback
  context are missing.
- Treating direct source edits as normal output for this skill.

### Notes

- When evidence is constrained, surface uncertainty in concise structural notes.

---

# Skill Model Alignment

## Summary
Defines alignment with the fixed execution-skill model and shared policy layer.

---

## Rule: Fixed Execution-Skill Scope
**Rule ID:** rpl-skill-model-alignment  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Rationale:** Prevents skill-scope drift and preserves cross-skill ownership
boundaries.

### Requirement

- Treat `react-placement-and-layering` as one of the fixed production execution
  skills.
- Keep primary output focused on placement plans and layer assignments.
- Coordinate with upstream architecture detection outputs and downstream reuse
  and implementation skills without absorbing their responsibilities.
- Keep shared policy/config as a separate baseline layer; do not re-model
  policy concerns as new execution-skill behavior.
- Preserve four-skill production scope:
  - `react-architecture-detection`
  - `react-placement-and-layering`
  - `react-reuse-update-new`
  - `react-implementation-discipline`

### Forbidden

- Expanding this skill to perform full implementation, broad refactors, or
  architecture detection recomputation.
- Reframing shared policy-layer behavior as a new execution-skill concern.
- Expanding production scope beyond the fixed four execution skills.

### Notes

- Cross-skill handoffs must remain explicit and machine-consumable.

---

# Implementation Handoff Formatting

## Summary
Defines downstream implementation-output formatting defaults referenced by this
planning skill.

---

## Rule: Implementation Output Format Defaults
**Rule ID:** rpl-implementation-handoff  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-placement-and-layering  
**Rationale:** Keeps handoff output reviewable and consistent across placement
and implementation stages.

### Requirement

- This skill remains planning-first and JSON-contract driven.
- When a downstream implementation handoff is requested, use these formatting
  defaults:
  - updated files: provide changed snippets by default
  - switch to unified diff when:
    - edits span non-adjacent regions in one file
    - changes touch imports, exports, and logic together
    - snippet-only output is likely to be misapplied
  - new files: provide full file content
  - existing files: avoid full-file dumps unless explicitly requested, or the
    file is small (about under 60 lines) and entirely changed
  - if a newly proposed file would exceed about 250 lines, split
    responsibilities instead of producing one oversized file
- Keep implementation-handoff guidance scoped to the approved placement plan and
  scope-governor limits.

### Forbidden

- Returning implementation output in free-form or low-context formats that
  increase patch-application risk.
- Combining structural migration and feature behavior changes in one handoff
  unless migration scope is explicitly requested.
- Expanding handoff scope beyond the selected placement plan without explicit
  structured scope expansion.

### Notes

- These defaults govern implementation handoff shape; they do not replace the
  mandatory placement JSON contract.
