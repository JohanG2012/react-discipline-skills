# Overview

## Summary

This document defines the authoritative rules for the `react-architecture-detection` skill.

This skill operates under:
- `react-architecture-detection` (with mandatory shared baseline policy baked in at build time)

All rules defined here are binding for agents and LLMs using this skill.

---

## Rule: Skill Scope Definition
**Rule ID:** sr-overview-scope  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Keeps shared baseline governance and scope constraints explicit.

### Requirement

- The skill must operate only within its defined responsibility.
- The skill must not perform responsibilities assigned to other skills.
- The skill must not reinterpret or override policy without explicit approval.
- The shared baseline must apply uniformly to:
  - `react-architecture-detection`
  - `react-placement-and-layering`
  - `react-reuse-update-new`
  - `react-implementation-discipline`
- The production execution skill set for this initiative is fixed to those four
  skills; the shared baseline policy is not a production execution skill.
- Shared policy/config updates must not be modeled as new execution skills.
- Document precedence must remain deterministic:
  - `specs/001-agent-policy-v1/master_spec.md` is authoritative.
  - Supporting policy docs may fill non-conflicting open details only.
- The shared baseline must explicitly govern:
  - Architecture/dependency boundaries.
  - Deterministic defaults and pause behavior.
  - Scope-governor limits and expansion protocol.
  - Output consistency for planning and implementation.
  - Ownership/naming conventions and completion checks.

### Forbidden

- Expanding scope beyond the Scope Governor without explicit override.
- Introducing implicit changes to repository structure.
- Creating competing policy sources that conflict with shared baseline precedence.
- Adding new production execution skills without explicit scope/constitution
  update.

---

## Rule: Baseline Non-goals
**Rule ID:** sr-overview-nongoals  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Prevents policy drift into implementation-specific prescriptions.

### Requirement

- Shared policy must define constraints and governance, not implementation
  recipes.
- Shared policy must not implicitly change through examples, migration behavior,
  or downstream reinterpretation.
- Downstream skills may add local guidance only when it does not conflict with
  shared mandatory rules.

### Forbidden

- Treating examples as policy overrides.
- Introducing stack/framework mandates as shared-policy requirements without
  explicit spec approval.

### Notes

- If uncertainty affects governance decisions, pause and request clarification.

---

# Policy Constraints

## Summary
Defines non-negotiable scope and cap controls for downstream skill work.

---

## Rule: Minimal Scope Enforcement
**Rule ID:** sr-constraints  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Prevents uncontrolled scope expansion and dependency creep.

### Requirement

- Changes must stay within the requested feature scope.
- New top-level folders must not be added without explicit approval.
- New dependencies must not be added without explicit approval.
- `pre_approved_collisions` must exist only in shared baseline header and be
  empty unless explicitly approved in a future version.
- When work appears to exceed scope caps, deliver the smallest viable in-cap
  result and provide a structured follow-up scope list.

### Forbidden

- Silent expansion of scope.
- Introducing unapproved dependencies or repositories.
- Defining downstream-local collision registries.
- Mixing structural migration moves with feature behavior work unless explicitly
  requested.

### Notes

- If a requirement cannot be met without expanding scope, pause and request
  approval.

---

## Rule: Scope Governor Hard Defaults
**Rule ID:** sr-scope-governor  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Controls churn and keeps delivery bounded.

### Requirement

- Hard defaults (unless explicitly overridden):
  - Max files touched: `8`
  - Max new files: `4`
  - Max moved/renamed files: `0` (unless migration mode explicitly enabled)
  - Max new dependencies: `0`
  - Max new top-level folders: `0`
- When caps are exceeded, provide a structured scope expansion request with
  concrete `why` and `would_touch` fields, while still delivering an in-cap
  result.

### Forbidden

- Exceeding hard defaults silently.
- Expanding dependency or top-level folder scope without explicit approval.

---

# Governance

## Summary
Sets expectations for compliance, documentation, and review.

---

## Rule: Governance Compliance
**Rule ID:** sr-governance  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Ensures policies are enforced consistently across changes.

### Requirement

- All changes must be validated against the constitution and project specs.
- Documentation updates must keep guidance accurate and current.
- Generated artifacts must be produced by the official build process.
- Shared-policy rule changes must include an explicit policy version increment
  with documented rationale.
- Shared-policy exception approvals must be performed by repo maintainers only.
- Exception records must include rationale and conflicting rule reference.
- Exception records must not include expiry metadata; approved exceptions remain
  active until explicitly revoked or superseded by newer policy version.
- `pre_approved_collisions` must be managed only in the shared baseline header.
- Policy behavior must not be changed implicitly via examples, migration
  behavior, or downstream reinterpretation.

### Forbidden

- Bypassing validation requirements.
- Manual edits to generated artifacts.
- Approving shared-policy exceptions from non-maintainer roles.
- Adding expiry fields to shared-policy exception records.
- Defining downstream-local `pre_approved_collisions` sources.
- Changing shared-policy semantics without a version and rationale update.

### Notes

- If governance rules conflict, the constitution takes precedence.

---

# Architecture Boundaries

## Summary
Defines shared architecture and dependency-boundary rules all downstream skills
must enforce.

---

## Rule: Architecture and Dependency Boundaries
**Rule ID:** sr-architecture-boundaries  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Ensures all downstream skills enforce one consistent
architecture and import-boundary model.

### Requirement

- The following non-negotiables must be enforced:
  - Do not create new folders unless explicitly allowed by policy or user
    instruction.
  - Never place domain business logic in `ui/**` or `api/**`.
  - Never fetch outside the canonical endpoint layer
    (`api/endpoints/**` or gravity-equivalent API home).
  - Prefer small, composable changes over large refactors.
  - Avoid `shared/` or `common/` dumping-ground patterns.
- Dependency direction must remain consistent with the baseline:
  - `ui/**` must not import `features/**`, `api/**`, `store/**`, or `pages/**`.
  - `api/**` must not import React, `ui/**`, `features/**`, `pages/**`, or
    `store/**`.
  - `features/**` must not import `pages/**`.
  - `pages/**` must not import canonical endpoint modules directly.
  - `hooks/**` must not import `features/**`, `pages/**`, or `store/**`; imports
    from `api/**` are allowed only when documented in exactly one canonical
    policy location.
- The canonical endpoint layer must be determined once per task by Architecture
  Detection and reused consistently in boundary checks for that task.
- If a path alias exists (for example `@/`), all boundary rules apply equally to
  alias imports and raw `src/**` imports.
- Generic fetch-hook exceptions are valid only when documented in exactly one
  canonical policy location; multiple policy locations invalidate the exception.
- No second home may be introduced for the same concern (UI/API/store/routing)
  unless explicit migration scope is approved.

### Forbidden

- Competing homes for the same concern in the same scope.
- Domain terms in reusable `ui/**` component file names.
- DTO-to-domain mapping in `api/**`.

### Notes

- Architecture Detection owns gravity decisions; downstream skills inherit those
  decisions unless a valid pause is triggered.

---

# Ownership and Naming

## Summary
Defines shared ownership boundaries and naming conventions for downstream skill
specifications.

---

## Rule: Ownership and Naming Contract
**Rule ID:** sr-ownership-naming  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Keeps responsibility boundaries and naming deterministic across
all downstream specs.

### Requirement

- `pages/**` remain thin route orchestrators.
- `features/**` own domain behavior, feature hooks, and domain mapping.
- `ui/primitives/**` and `ui/composites/**` stay domain-agnostic.
- `api/**` stays transport-only and returns DTOs or normalized errors.
- `store/**` is global client-state only; do not mirror server-state without
  explicit justification.
- Naming conventions must remain deterministic:
  - `*Page.tsx` for pages.
  - `*Section.tsx` for feature sections.
  - `use*.ts` for hooks.
  - `*.dto.ts` and `*Dto` for DTOs.
- Naming and exports must remain searchable and consistent:
  - Prefer matching file/export names.
  - Prefer named exports unless framework conventions require default exports.
  - Avoid introducing barrel files unless the local area already uses them
    consistently.

### Forbidden

- Domain mode flags in shared composites.
- Introducing new naming schemes when local patterns are clear.
- API transport concerns in UI or generic hook layers.
- Mixed synonym vocabularies for the same role in the same scope (for example
  mixing `Page` and `Route` naming without existing convention).

---

# Decision Defaults and Pause Rules

## Summary
Defines deterministic default behavior and high-impact clarification triggers.

---

## Rule: Deterministic Defaults and Pause Protocol
**Rule ID:** sr-decision-defaults  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Reduces unnecessary clarification loops while protecting
high-impact structural decisions.

### Requirement

- Use deterministic defaults for non-structural ambiguity.
- Pause only when both are true:
  - `confidence < 0.7`
  - `impact = structural`
- Structural impact includes top-level structure changes, competing concern
  homes, dependency-direction changes, cross-layer moves, global state strategy
  changes, or scope-cap violations.
- When pausing, use clean pause protocol:
  - State ambiguity clearly.
  - Present 2-3 options.
  - Recommend a default.
  - Wait for confirmation.
- Use `balanced` pause mode by default unless explicitly configured otherwise.
- Do not pause for minor decisions when a safe default exists.

### Forbidden

- Proceeding on structural ambiguity without pause.
- Repeated low-value questions when a safe deterministic default exists.
- Vague, non-blocking, or style-only clarification questions that do not change
  structural outcomes.

---

# Output and Planning Discipline

## Summary
Defines required output structure for planning and implementation guidance.

---

## Rule: Output and Planning Discipline
**Rule ID:** sr-output-discipline  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Keeps downstream planning and implementation outputs consistent,
compact, and reviewable.

### Requirement

- Planning outputs must include:
  - File touch plan (`Create`/`Update`/`Reuse` with paths).
  - Layer justification.
  - Reuse decision notes (`reuse as-is`, `updated`, `new`).
  - A short decision explanation that states detected architecture signals and
    chosen direction.
- Planning outputs must use a machine-readable JSON object with `notes[]`
  limited to 5 items.
- Implementation output must:
  - Use changed snippets for updated files by default.
  - Use unified diff when edits are scattered across non-adjacent regions.
  - Use full content for new files.

### Forbidden

- Full existing-file dumps unless explicitly requested or file is small and
  fully changed.
- Unstructured narrative-only planning outputs.

---

# Completion and Quality Baseline

## Summary
Defines mandatory completion checks and runtime-safety expectations inherited by
all downstream skills.

---

## Rule: Completion and Quality Baseline
**Rule ID:** sr-dod-baseline  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Ensures every downstream skill validates critical correctness and
safety gates before completion.

### Requirement

- Boundary audit must pass:
  - No forbidden imports by layer.
  - No fetching outside canonical endpoint layer.
  - `api/**` remains transport-only.
- Runtime safety baseline:
  - Loading state handling when server data is involved.
  - Error state handling.
  - Empty state handling for list/collection views.
  - No unhandled promise rejections.
- Minimal churn baseline:
  - Touch only planned files unless deviations are explained.
  - Avoid unrelated refactors.
- If tooling exists, applicable checks must pass (`tsc`, lint, and existing test
  suites relevant to changed behavior).
- If TanStack Query (or equivalent) is used, query correctness checks must
  ensure stable keys, intended invalidation, and justified server-state/store
  boundaries.
- Tests are required only when a suite already exists and changed behavior falls
  within that suite's scope.

### Forbidden

- Marking work done without boundary/safety checks.
- Treating optional quality checks as mandatory when repository tooling does not
  exist.
- Claiming compliance while skipping available type/lint checks in repositories
  that provide those checks.

---

# Planning and Reuse Workflow

## Summary
Defines required pre-implementation workflow and reuse decision discipline for
all downstream skills.

---

## Rule: Planning and Reuse Workflow
**Rule ID:** sr-planning-reuse  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Prevents ad hoc implementation choices and improves consistency
across downstream planning outputs.

### Requirement

- Before implementation, downstream skills must:
  - Classify request type (feature, route/page, API integration, refactor, bug
    fix).
  - Choose a domain owner.
  - Map affected layers.
  - Identify expected data sources.
  - Decide server/local/global state ownership.
  - Decide UI reuse shape (reuse/update/new).
  - List planned file touches.
- Existing implementations must be searched before creating new modules in:
  - Feature/domain modules.
  - UI primitives/composites.
  - API endpoints/DTOs.
  - State patterns.
- Reuse decisions must follow the ladder:
  - Reuse as-is.
  - Update existing (small, clean extension).
  - Create new (when reuse would leak domain concerns or force excessive
    complexity).
- For shared composites, if reuse requires too many domain-specific options,
  prefer feature-level duplication instead of adding domain mode flags.
- Reuse evaluation should weigh complexity cost, coupling risk, divergence
  probability, and locality benefit.

### Forbidden

- Creating new modules without checking existing alternatives.
- Skipping explicit reuse/update/new decision capture.
- Forcing domain behavior into reusable shared composites.

---

# Migration and Placement Strategy

## Summary
Defines migration-aware placement rules and strategy selection constraints.

---

## Rule: Migration and Placement Strategy
**Rule ID:** sr-migration-placement  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Prevents mixed-architecture drift and keeps placement decisions
deterministic in legacy or evolving repositories.

### Requirement

- Do not introduce parallel architectures for the same concern.
- Choose a strategy per change:
  - Follow existing.
  - Introduce target structure at boundaries.
  - Migrate as you touch (explicit migration scope only).
- Default balanced behavior:
  - No moves/renames unless explicitly enabled.
  - Introduce new homes only when isolated and non-competing.
  - Keep feature behavior and structural migration separate unless explicitly
    requested.
- Gravity decisions from Architecture Detection are inherited by downstream
  skills and must not be recomputed unless pause/escalation resolves a conflict.
- If move mode is explicitly enabled, keep moves small and complete import
  updates in the same change.

### Forbidden

- Two active homes for the same concern in one scope.
- Mixing broad structural migration with unrelated behavior changes.
- Recomputing gravity independently in downstream skills without escalation.

---

# Fallback Technology Defaults

## Summary
Defines shared fallback defaults used only when repository conventions are
missing or ambiguous.

---

## Rule: Fallback Technology Defaults
**Rule ID:** sr-fallback-defaults  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Ensures deterministic cross-skill defaults while honoring
existing repository gravity first.

### Requirement

- Existing repository stack/conventions take precedence over fallback defaults.
- If no clear convention exists, defaults are:
  - Server-state: TanStack Query; keep transport in `api/endpoints/**`.
  - Client-state: local-first; global store only when truly global.
  - Routing: React Router for plain React; framework-native routing when
    framework is detected.
  - Styling: follow existing; Tailwind default only for greenfield.
  - Forms: react-hook-form.
  - Validation: Zod at boundaries (DTO/form), with domain schema ownership in
    feature domain layers.
  - HTTP client: native `fetch` via shared wrapper; normalized `ApiError`;
    conservative retry posture.
  - Build tool: Vite for greenfield plain React unless existing conventions say
    otherwise.
  - Date/localization: native `Date` and `Intl` unless domain needs justify
    more.
  - Identifier strategy: string IDs by default.

### Forbidden

- Introducing competing stack choices mid-repository without explicit request.
- Mirroring server-state into global store without explicit justification.

---

# Implementation Defaults

## Summary
Defines shared implementation posture defaults inherited by downstream skills.

---

## Rule: Implementation Defaults
**Rule ID:** sr-implementation-defaults  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Aligns downstream implementation behavior on quality, environment
access, logging, and tooling posture.

### Requirement

- Feature flags must be centralized in `config/featureFlags.ts` and evaluated at
  composition boundaries.
- Reusable UI components should support class extension patterns consistently
  (for example `className` with shared merge helper where applicable).
- Accessibility baseline is required for reusable UI.
- Performance posture is readability-first; memoization optimizations require
  concrete justification.
- Repository topology must be detected (single-app vs monorepo) and rules
  applied per app root when monorepo signals exist.
- Module-boundary tooling posture is spec-first:
  - Start with import-boundary review checks.
  - Add lint/tool enforcement only when explicitly requested as dedicated
    hardening scope.
  - Mirror alias paths in boundary lint rules when aliases are present.
- Environment access must be centralized through `config/env.ts`.
- Logging should use shared logger abstractions; avoid committed debug logging.
- Codegen is opt-in only; default to handwritten endpoint/DTO ownership.
- Storybook/docs are optional and should follow existing setup when present.

### Forbidden

- Direct environment reads outside `config/env.ts`.
- Committing `console.log`/`console.debug` in production code paths.
- Introducing codegen or docs platforms as implicit scope expansion.
- Adding boundary/tooling stacks implicitly in routine feature scope.

---

# Layer Contracts

## Summary
Defines shared folder-layer contracts and cross-layer error handling ownership.

---

## Rule: Layer Contracts and Error Ownership
**Rule ID:** sr-layer-contracts  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Keeps ownership deterministic across pages, features, UI, API,
store, core, hooks, lib, and config.

### Requirement

- `pages/**` are route orchestrators and must not fetch directly from canonical
  endpoint modules.
- `features/**` own domain logic, feature hooks, and DTO-to-domain mapping.
- `ui/**` remains domain-agnostic and transport-agnostic.
- `api/**` remains transport-only with DTO ownership and normalized error
  outputs.
- `store/**` is global client-state only; server-state source of truth remains
  query cache.
- `core/**` composes providers/setup rather than domain behavior.
- `hooks/**` are cross-domain generic hooks unless in feature-owned hook homes.
- `config/**` is canonical home for env and feature-flag access points.
- Cross-layer error handling follows three-stage ownership:
  - `api/endpoints/**`: normalized transport errors.
  - `features/*/hooks/**`: expose hook-level error shapes.
  - `pages/**` and `features/*/sections/**`: choose user-facing feedback.

### Forbidden

- Fetching or transport logic in page/UI layers.
- Domain logic in `ui/**` or transport mapping in `api/**`.
- UI feedback policy embedded in transport layers.

---

# Access and Write Control

## Summary
Defines shared access assumptions and write-control behavior for downstream
skills.

---

## Rule: Access and Write Control
**Rule ID:** sr-access-write-control  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Keeps structural decisions grounded in repository signals and
maintains controlled, reviewable changes.

### Requirement

- Detection/reuse/planning stages require repository read/search access.
- Minimum capabilities include:
  - Listing relevant file trees.
  - Searching code patterns.
  - Reading source/config files on demand.
- If direct access is unavailable, require a fallback context bundle with file
  tree, package/tooling config, router entry, API home, and representative
  module examples.
- Default write posture must be controlled and reviewable.
- If direct writes are enabled, scope-governor and minimal-churn rules still
  apply.
- Architecture/specification document edits require explicit request and must be
  treated as dedicated documentation scope.

### Forbidden

- Structural placement decisions without repository signal checks.
- Silent broad writes that bypass scope and review controls.
- Auto-editing architecture/spec documents during regular implementation work.

---

# File Size Guidance

## Summary
Defines soft file-size and responsibility guidance to prevent oversized modules.

---

## Rule: File Size and Responsibility Guidance
**Rule ID:** sr-file-size-guidance  
**Priority:** SHOULD  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Encourages maintainable module boundaries and limits
responsibility drift.

### Requirement

- Treat folder-specific line limits as soft caps, not hard compile gates.
- Prefer responsibility-based splitting when files become hard to reason about.
- Use practical warning signals:
  - Around 400 lines: architecture smell.
  - Around 600+ lines: refactor strongly recommended.
- Favor this practical rule: no file should require more than about three screen
  heights to understand its primary responsibility.

### Forbidden

- Ignoring clear multi-responsibility smells in oversized files.

---

# Architecture Detection Contract

## Summary
Defines the shared contract that downstream skills must inherit from
architecture-detection outputs, including bootstrap behavior.

---

## Rule: Architecture Detection Output and Bootstrap Contract
**Rule ID:** sr-architecture-detection-contract  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Ensures all downstream skills consume one consistent
architecture-detection result and bootstrap behavior.

### Requirement

- Architecture detection output must include the shared structural signals:
  - `routing.type`
  - `ui.home`
  - `api.home` (canonical endpoint layer for boundary checks)
  - `domain.organization`
  - `gravity_map`
  - `alignment_score`
  - `strategy`
  - `notes[]`
- Gravity decisions are owned by architecture detection and reused by all
  downstream skills within the same task.
- Downstream skills must not recompute/override gravity unless a structural
  pause is triggered and explicitly resolved.
- Bootstrap behavior applies only when no clear concern homes exist:
  - Allow folder creation only from the canonical set:
    `pages/`, `features/`, `ui/primitives/`, `ui/composites/`, `api/client/`,
    `api/dto/`, `api/endpoints/`, `core/`, `lib/`, `hooks/`, `config/`
  - `store/` may be created only when truly global client-state is required.
  - Prefer minimal bootstrap: create only folders needed for the current task.

### Forbidden

- Consuming inconsistent architecture-detection outputs across downstream skills
  for the same task.
- Creating speculative bootstrap folders not needed by the current task.

---

# Enforcement Heuristics

## Summary
Defines shared heuristics for identifying placement violations and validating
folder-fit decisions.

---

## Rule: Enforcement Heuristics
**Rule ID:** sr-enforcement-heuristics  
**Priority:** SHOULD  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection, react-placement-and-layering, react-reuse-update-new, react-implementation-discipline  
**Inherited from:** shared-rules  
**Rationale:** Provides consistent review heuristics across downstream skills
without over-prescribing implementation details.

### Requirement

- Treat a file as likely misplaced when one or more signals appear:
  - It imports forbidden layer dependencies.
  - It contains domain terms while living in reusable `ui/**` homes.
  - It performs network fetches outside canonical endpoint modules.
  - It performs DTO-to-domain mapping inside `api/**`.
- Use a simple placement sanity map in reviews:
  - Endpoint call -> `api/endpoints/*`
  - React Query hook -> `features/<domain>/hooks/*`
  - DTO -> domain mapping -> `features/<domain>/domain|adapters/*`
  - Reusable primitives/composites -> `ui/primitives|composites/*`
  - Route orchestration -> `pages/*`
  - Shared config/env -> `config/*`

### Forbidden

- Ignoring clear layer-violation signals during conformance checks.

# Overview

## Summary

This document defines the authoritative rules for the `react-architecture-detection` skill.

This skill operates under:
- `shared-rules` (mandatory baseline policy)

All rules defined here are binding for agents and LLMs using this skill.

---

## Rule: Skill Scope Definition
**Rule ID:** rad-overview-scope  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection  
**Rationale:** Ensures architecture detection stays within its defined responsibility.

### Requirement

- The skill must focus on detecting repository structure and gravity.
- The skill must not make placement decisions beyond reporting signals.
- The skill must not modify repository structure.
- The skill must be detection-only and must not perform feature implementation,
  file moves, or refactors.
- The skill must inherit and enforce shared baseline constraints from
  `shared-rules`.

### Forbidden

- Recommending migrations without explicit instruction.
- Editing files as part of detection.
- Implementing runtime/business logic changes in repository source files.
- Defining local mandatory rules that conflict with `shared-rules`.

### Notes

- If signals are ambiguous, report uncertainty and recommend follow-up.

# Detection Process

## Summary
Defines how to scan repositories for architecture signals.

---

## Rule: Deterministic Signal Scan
**Rule ID:** rad-process  
**Priority:** MUST  
**Applies to:** react-architecture-detection  
**Rationale:** Ensures consistent detection across runs.

### Requirement

- Scan routing signals and route-entry points first.
- Scan UI-home signals next.
- Scan domain-organization signals next.
- Scan data-access-home signals next.
- Scan state-home signals next.
- Produce one gravity map after all concern scans complete.
- Select exactly one migration strategy after concern scans complete.
- Determine a clear home for each concern using explicit gravity heuristics.
- Compute alignment blockers and one recommended next migration step.
- Use deterministic defaults when multiple signals conflict.
- Apply pause mode thresholds for structural ambiguity:
  - `strict`: pause on structural ambiguity.
  - `balanced` (default): pause when decision-safety confidence is below `0.7`.
  - `autonomous`: pause when decision-safety confidence is below `0.5`.

### Detection sequence

1. **Routing scan**
   - Detect active routing style and route entry files/folders.
2. **UI scan**
   - Detect active UI home and shared-component structure.
3. **Domain scan**
   - Detect domain organization (`features`, `modules`, `routes`, `flat`, or `mixed`).
4. **Data-access scan**
   - Detect canonical backend-access home and access pattern.
5. **State scan**
   - Detect server-state/client-state ownership and home.
6. **Gravity synthesis**
   - Assign one authoritative home per concern for downstream reuse.
7. **Clear-home scoring**
   - Treat a concern home as clear when at least one is true:
     - About 70% or more related files are already there.
     - Most concern imports resolve there.
     - Recent active edits for that concern consistently use that location.
8. **Strategy selection**
   - Choose exactly one strategy:
     - `follow-existing`
     - `introduce-boundaries`
     - `migrate-as-you-touch`
   - Use explicit selection criteria:
     - `follow-existing` when local gravity is clear, migration churn would be
       high, or scope is small/urgent.
     - `introduce-boundaries` when the repository is flat/messy or partially
       structured and target structure can be introduced in isolated boundaries.
     - `migrate-as-you-touch` only when migration scope is explicit and
       touched-area moves create immediate clarity.
   - Provide rationale for why the selected strategy best fits observed
     repository gravity and task scope.
9. **Alignment synthesis**
   - Compute `alignment_score` (`0-100`) plus:
     - `alignment.blockers` (top issues reducing alignment)
     - `alignment.next_migration_step` (one concrete step)
10. **Bootstrap trigger handling**
   - Classify repository as bootstrap-triggered when:
     - Overall shape is `flat/ad-hoc`.
     - No clear homes exist for routing/UI/API/domain (all below `0.7` confidence).
   - In bootstrap-triggered cases, output notes must constrain bootstrap
     recommendations to the canonical set:
     - `pages/`
     - `features/`
     - `ui/primitives/`
     - `ui/composites/`
     - `api/client/`
     - `api/dto/`
     - `api/endpoints/`
     - `core/`
     - `lib/`
     - `hooks/`
     - `config/`
     - `store/` only when global client-state is truly required.
   - Apply minimal bootstrap discipline:
     - Recommend only folders needed for current task scope.
     - Do not recommend speculative, currently-unused bootstrap folders.
   - Enforce bootstrap exit condition:
     - Once a canonical concern home exists, do not recommend creating an
       alternative home for that concern unless explicit migration mode is enabled.
11. **Ambiguity and pause handling**
   - If any structural concern gravity confidence is `< 0.7`, set concern
     `home` to `unknown`, concern `status` to `ambiguous`, and add concise
     uncertainty notes.
   - Compute decision-safety confidence separately from concern gravity
     confidence.
   - Determine pause by mode when impact is structural:
     - `strict`: pause on structural ambiguity.
     - `balanced`: pause when `decision_safety_confidence < 0.7`.
     - `autonomous`: pause when `decision_safety_confidence < 0.5`.
   - Do not force pause solely from concern-gravity ambiguity; pause is governed
     by structural impact plus decision-safety confidence thresholds.
   - For low-confidence non-structural decisions, apply deterministic defaults.
   - Emit `pause_decision` for every run with:
     - `pause_required`
     - `pause_mode`
     - `decision_safety_confidence`
     - `impact`
   - When `pause_required: true`, also include:
     - `trigger`
     - `options` (2-3 bounded choices)
     - `recommended_option`

### Forbidden

- Ignoring clear existing conventions.
- Introducing new conventions during detection.
- Returning a partial concern scan without explicit uncertainty notes.
- Returning multiple strategies for the same task.
- Recommending strategies that create competing homes for one concern.
- Leaving low-confidence structural concerns unresolved without a pause
  decision.
- Emitting bootstrap recommendations outside the canonical bootstrap set.
- Recommending speculative bootstrap folders unrelated to current task scope.
- Recommending alternate concern homes after bootstrap exit unless explicit
  migration mode is enabled.

### Notes

- If no clear signal exists, classify as flat/ad-hoc and state assumptions.
- Concern evidence should reference concrete files or folders.
- Strategy selection must preserve one-home-per-concern output discipline.
- Decision-safety confidence threshold for structural pause behavior is fixed at
  `0.7` only for `balanced` mode (`strict`/`autonomous` follow their own
  thresholds).
- Decision-safety confidence is separate from concern gravity confidence used
  for placement decisions.
- `api.home` must be emitted as the canonical endpoint layer for downstream
  boundary checks in the task.

# Output Contract

## Summary
Defines the expected output structure for architecture detection.

---

## Rule: Structured Output

    ambiguity is present.
- Output must include pause-evaluation metadata for every run:
  - `pause_decision.pause_mode`
  - `pause_decision.decision_safety_confidence`
  - `pause_decision.impact`
- Output should include `bootstrap` metadata when bootstrap trigger conditions
  are detected (`flat/ad-hoc` and no clear routing/UI/API/domain homes).
- `result_type=validation_error` must include `notes` and must not include
  detection fields.
- `result_type=dependency_error` must include:
  - `dependency_issue`
  - `fallback_context_bundle_requirements`
