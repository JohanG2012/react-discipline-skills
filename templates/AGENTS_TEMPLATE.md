# <Skill Title> — Agent Rule Index

## Overview
This document defines the authoritative lookup index for agents/LLMs using the
`<skill-name>` skill.

Shared baseline policy is materialized per skill in `./.shared-rules/` to keep
this skill portable when installed standalone.

Read behavior:
- `inline` rules are embedded below and must be treated as always-on guidance.
- `reference` rules are listed in the index; load them from their source file when relevant.
