# US1 Discovery Check (60-Second)

## Goal

Verify a repository visitor can identify major completed milestones from `CHANGELOG.md` within 60 seconds.

## Procedure

1. Open `<REPO_ROOT>/CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Start a 60-second timer.
3. Identify the four production skill milestones listed under major milestones.
4. Confirm each entry includes both:
   - what changed
   - why it matters
5. Mark pass/fail per reviewer.

## Reviewer Sheet
